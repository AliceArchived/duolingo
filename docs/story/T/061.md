# The Reunion

Lucy is getting ready for a date. Her granddaughter, Lin, walks into the room

- **Lucy**: Lin! Should I wear the black dress or the green dress?
- **Lin**: The black dress is a little ... short.
- **Lucy**: Perfect! I'll wear the black dress!
- **Lin**: Well, you do have great legs.
  - Where are you going?
- **Lucy**: I have a date tonight!
- **Lin**: Did you meet him on the internet?
- **Lucy**: Actually, I have known him for fifty years.
- **Lin**: Fifty years?!
- **Lucy**: Yes! We went to high school together. I remember he had the most beautiful brown hair.
  - I haven't seen him since then...
- **Lin**: Wait... are you nervous? I can't believe it!
- **Lucy**: I'm not nervous! Do I look nervous?
- **Lin**: A little, yes. Why are you nervous?!
- **Lucy**: Well... so much has changed in fifty years!
- **Lin**: I know! The internet, cell phones, frozen yogurt —
- **Lucy**: No, no... we are not young anymore.
- **Lin**: Grandma, you are still very beautiful!
- **Lucy**: I'm not talking about me! I'm worried about him!
  - Maybe he lost all of his beautiful hair!

## Writing

### Do you think Lucy should worry about the date? Why?

Yes, Lucy should worry about the date. We all have good memories ~~about~~ our **youth**. But time is **cruel** — it changes everything. ~~A lot of times~~, if someone I haven't seen for a long time, I'd rather not see them again. Just keep the good memories.

> Corrections:

1. “We all have good memories about our **youth**.”
   - → should be "**of** our youth".
2. “A lot of times, if someone I haven’t seen for a long time, I’d rather not see them again.”
   - → this sentence structure is awkward and incomplete. Better: “Often, when I haven’t seen someone for a long time, I’d rather not see them again.”
3. “Just keep the good memories.”
   - → grammatically fine, but should be linked to the previous sentence more smoothly.

Yes, Lucy should worry about the date. We all have good memories **of** our **youth**, but time is **cruel** — it **changes** everything. **Often**, when I **haven’t seen** someone for a long time, I’d rather not see them again. **It’s better to** just keep the good memories.

是的，露西应该为这次约会感到担心。我们每个人对青春都有美好的回忆，但时间是残酷的——它改变了一切。很多时候，当我很久没有见过一个人时，我宁愿不再见他们。保留美好的回忆就好。
