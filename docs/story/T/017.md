# The Action Figure - B2

Junior and his dad, Eddy, knock on the front door of a house. A man answers the door.

- **Junior**: Hello, we used to live here, and I need to look in my old room.

Before the man can respond, Junior walks in.

- **Man**: Excuse me!
- **Eddy**: I'm sorry! We moved out three years ago, and my son thinks he left a toy behind.
- **Man**: I would've thrown it out. I don't like toys ... or children.
- **Junior**: Please let me check! The "Space Viking" action figure with a special shield is very valuable.
- **Man**: I don't care. You have to leave.
- **Junior**: But we could share the profit with you.
- **Man**: **Profits**? Fine, but be quick.

Eddy and Junior enter Junior's old room.

- **Junior**: The guy turned my old room into a stupid gym.
- **Eddy**: Wow! He has the most expensive **stationary bike** on the market!
  - I'll just ride it for five minutes. He won't mind...

While Eddy gets on the bike, Junior finds a loose **floorboard** and lifts it up.

- **Junior**: I'm not sure, but I think I hid it under the floorboards ...

Junior removes another floorboard as Eddy **pedals** faster.

- **Eddy**: This bike is incredible!

Junior reaches under the floorboards and pulls out an action figure.

- **Junior**: We're rich.
- **Eddy**: Great!
  - I can buy one of these bikes!

Junior examines the action figure.

- **Junior**: Wait, this isn't the one with the shield! It's the one with the **ax**. It's not rare! It's worthless.
  - We shouldn't have wasted our time coming here.

The man walks in. He sees Eddy riding the bike and a hole in the floor.

- **Man**: What are you doing?!

Eddy falls off the bike and breaks the pedal.

- **Eddy**: This is embarrassing...
- **Man**: You'll have to pay for the damage to the floor and the bike!
- **Junior**: But we didn't bring any money.
- **Man**: Then you should give me your valuable action figure!
- **Junior**: You've got a deal!

## Sentences

- **“Profits?”**
  - Consider changing to:
    - **“Profit?”**
    - Since Junior only mentioned **sharing the profit** (singular), not multiple forms of income.
    - But both are acceptable in casual speech depending on tone.

## Vocabulary

- Stationary bike: 动感单车
- Floorboard: 地板条
- pedal: vt 踩...的踏板
