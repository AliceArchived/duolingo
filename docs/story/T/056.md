# The Playwright - B2

Oscar is volunteering at the local theater during a performance. He's greeting audience members with the play's director.

- **Woman**: Apparently, the writer of the play is coming tonight.
- **Oscar**: Wow! Is he here yet?
- **Woman**: Maybe ... nobody knows what he looks like, though I've heard he has a big moustache — like you.

The director leaves as an actor approaches.

- **Actor**: Are you who I think you are? Your work is incredible!
- **Oscar**: Oh, a fan of my art. Thank you.
- **Actor**: Could you give me some acting notes?
- **Oscar**: You should ask the director.
- **Actor**: But you're the creative genius!

Oscar thinks for a moment.

- **Oscar**: OK. Instead of speaking your final lines, you should sing them.
- **Actor**: Brilliant!

Later, at the end of the play, the actor lies on the stage, covered in blood. He sings his final lines as he pretends to die.

The audience cheers loudly.

After the play, the actor hugs Oscar **backstage**.

- **Actor**: The audience should've been applauding you — not me!
- **Oscar**: Yes ... I guess you're right.

Just then, a man with a moustache rushes backstage.

- **Man**: Who changed the ending of the play?

The actor points at Oscar.

- **Actor**: That was the playwright's idea!
- **Man**: Him? I'm the playwright!

Everyone gasps.

- **Actor**: I thought he was the playwright because of his moustache!

Furious, the playwright turns to Oscar.

- **Man**: You ruined my play!
- **Oscar**: That's not what the audience thought! Did you hear them cheering?
- **Man**: The final scene was supposed to be tragic, but you turned it into a ridiculous cheerful musical!
- **Oscar**: Frankly, the play was **depressing**, so I did you a favour.
- **Man**: Enough! I'm leaving!
- **Oscar**: No, I'm leaving!

As Oscar walks towards the exit, he turns back for a moment.

- **Oscar**: By the way, my mustache is clearly superior to yours!

## Writing

### Do you think the playwright was too rude to Oscar? Why or why not?

I believe that the **playwright** is not rude. If I were in the same position, I may act more angry. Oscar should not change other people's product/work.

> Corrections:

1. “may act more angry”
   - 应为 “might have acted angrier” 或 “might act more angrily”。
2. “other people's product”
   - 建议使用复数 “products” 或加上定冠词 “the product”。

I believe that the playwright is not rude. If I were in the same position, I **might have acted** more **angrily**. Oscar should not change other people's **products**.

我认为剧作家并不粗鲁。如果我是他，我可能会更生气一些。奥斯卡不应该擅自更改别人的作品。

### Rewrite Version

Do you think the playwright was too rude to Oscar?

这个问题虽然是现在时 “do you think”，但其中的事件 “was too rude” 已经发生在**过去的故事情节**中。所以回答中要描述的“剧作家的行为”是**过去发生的事情**，因此需要使用**过去时**。

I don't think the playwright **was** too rude to Oscar. He **was clearly upset** because Oscar changed the ending of his play **without permission**. Anyone would be angry if their creative work was **altered**. Although the audience enjoyed the new version, the playwright had **every right** to defend his original vision.

我不认为剧作家对奥斯卡太粗鲁了。他之所以生气，是因为奥斯卡擅自更改了他的剧本结局。任何人在自己的创作被擅自修改时都会感到愤怒。虽然观众很喜欢新的版本，但剧作家完全有权维护他原本的构想。
