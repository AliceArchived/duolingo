# The Password

Lucy is looking at her computer.

- **Lucy**: Lin! I can't log into my computer! I forgot my password.
- **Lin**: OK, I'll look at it... The password hint is "The name of your first love."
- **Lucy**: Hm...
  - Well, when I was a spy...
  - I had to bring some medicine over the border...
- **Lin**: What?
- **Lucy**: At the time, I was working with a man named Eduardo...
- **Lin**: Eduardo?

Lin types the name into the computer.

- **Lin**: That's not the password.
- **Lucy**: No, I never loved Eduardo. He was stupid.

  - Because of Eduardo, the enemies caught us.
  - They took us to a secret room in the embassy.

- **Lin**: Uh-oh.
- **Lucy**: The enemy leader came to see me. We spent days talking. Finally, he let us leave.
- **Lin**: Oh, really?
- **Lucy**: We became good friends.
- **Lin**: What was his name?
- **Lucy**: Jean-Luc.

Lin types the name into the computer.

- **Lin**: That's not the password.
- **Lucy**: He gave me money to get on a plane.
- **Lin**: Then what happened?
- **Lucy**: Well... The **pilot** was a very handsome young man.
  - Kind, funny, smart... his name was **Rafael**.
- **Lin**: I'll try "Rafael" ... no. That's not the password.
- **Lucy**: No, Rafael died.
- **Lin**: What?
- **Lucy**: He had a heart attack while we were flying.
- **Lin**: Oh no!
- **Lucy**: His last words were, "Take care of the Black Rose."
  - And I did.
- **Lin**: What's the Black Rose?
- **Lucy**: The airplane. It was the most beautiful plane in the world.
- **Lin**: Black Rose! Yes! That's the password!

## Writing

### Lucy was a spy. What kind of work are you interested in? Why?

I want to be a quantan trader. I can earn lots of money. But for my age, it seems impossible to achieve that dream.

> Corrections:

1. "quantan trader"
   - → typo: should be "**quant trader**" (short for **quantitative** trader).
2. "I can earn lots of money."
   - → grammatically fine, but more natural phrasing is "because it can be very profitable."
3. "But for my age, it seems impossible to achieve that dream."
   - → better phrased as "But at my age, it seems impossible to achieve that dream."

I want to be a **quant trader** because it can be very **profitable**. But at my age, it seems impossible to achieve that dream.

我想成为一名量化交易员，因为这个职业非常赚钱。但以我现在的年龄，实现这个梦想似乎不太可能。
