# The Auction - B2

Oscar is selling his art at an **auction** organized by his friend Bea. **Disguised** in a huge hat, fake beard, and sunglasses, he's waiting for people to start **bidding** on his painting.

As his painting is brought to the front of the room, Oscar turns to a man standing beside him.

- **Oscar**: Now this is an incredible painting.
- **Man**: This? No, this painting is awful! No one would ever want it!

The man leaves.

- **Oscar**: How rude! That man has even worse taste than Eddy.

Bea starts the **bidding**.

- **Bea**: Does anyone want to bid $50 for this painting?
- **Eddy**: 50!

Oscar sees Eddy sitting up front.

- **Oscar**: Eddy is **bidding on** my painting? He has better taste than I thought.

Bea continues the auction.

- **Bea**: How about $60?

There's a long pause. Oscar looks around nervously as no one else places a bid.

- **Oscar**: $60!
- **Bea**: Do I hear $70?
- **Eddy**: 100!
- **Bea**: Wow, $100! Do I hear $120?
- **Oscar**: $1000!
- **Eddy**: 1000?! I can't afford that.
- **Bea**: Sold! For $1000!
- **Oscar**: I can't believe I spent $1000. But wait until everyone hears how much my painting is worth!

After the auction, Eddy approaches Oscar, who is still in disguise. Eddy doesn't recognize him.

- **Eddy**: Congratulations! That artist is one of the best in our city.
- **Oscar**: Do you really think so?
- **Eddy**: Of course! You're lucky to have it.

Eddy starts walking away, but Oscar stops him.

- **Oscar**: Wait! You should have it.
- **Eddy**: But I can't afford that.
- **Oscar**: Don't worry about it ... I'll give it to you for $100. You deserve it more than me.
- **Eddy**: I can't believe this. Thanks so much! It's going to look great in my bathroom.
- **Oscar**: Bathroom?! You're putting my painting in your bathroom?!

## Writing

### Eddy really liked Oscar's painting! Imagine what the painting looks like and describe it.

I think that the painting might be about **a** man and woman since Eddy is such a **sensitive** guy. He loves romantic stories and hope to find a true love for himself one day.

> Correction:

1. “**a** man and woman”
   - → should be **a man and a woman** for parallel structure.
2. “**hope** to find”
   - → subject-verb agreement error.
   - Should be **hopes**.

I think that the painting might be about **a** man and **a** woman, since Eddy is such a **sensitive** guy. He **loves** romantic stories and **hopes** to find true love for himself one day.

---

I think that painting might be **of** a man and a woman, since Eddy is a **sensitive** guy and **easily** touched by love stories. The painting **is** probably about a love story, so Eddy **has** been touched.

> Correction:

1. "might be of a man and a woman"
   - → grammatically correct, but “of” can be a bit vague. “Might **depict** a man and a woman” is clearer.
2. "since Eddy is a **sensitive** guy and easily touched by love stories"
   - grammatically fine, but "easily touched" is a bit awkward
   - "deeply moved" or "gets emotional" might flow better.
3. "so Eddy has been touched"
   - awkward ending. “Touched” is okay, but sounds a bit unnatural alone in this context.

I think that painting might **depict** a man and a woman, since Eddy is a sensitive guy who **gets emotional over** love stories. The painting is probably about a love story, which is why Eddy **was so moved**.

## Sentences

- Bea starts the bidding.
  - This is fine, but if you want to make it clearer or a little more formal for a B2 reader, you could say:
    - Bea begins the auction. or
    - Bea opens the bidding.
