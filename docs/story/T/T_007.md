# This Week's School Highlights - B2

By Ricky Mathis, School Newspaper Editor

It's been another fun-filled week at the high school, the highlight of which was the annual Autumn Dance! The head of the event planning committee, Zari, decorated the entire gym by herself.

When asked to comment, Zari said:

- **Zari**: I wanted to make the gym look like a beach and it only took eighteen hours!
  - But then it took thirty-six hours to sweep up all the sand.

In other news, our soccer team won their game on Monday, in spite of **an equipment mix-up**. Team captain and **goalie**, Zari, who was mysteriously covered in sand, apologized:

- **Zari**: I don't know how I brought basketballs instead of soccer balls.
  - I must have been exhausted.

**Spectators** noted that the team's defense was excellent, especially considering that the **goalie** took a nap during the game.

Finally, the school play **premiered** this Wednesday. Everyone was amazed by the unique performance of the director and star of the play, Zari.

Usually, Hamlet is three hours long, but Zari's quick **delivery of the lines** shortened the play to forty-five minutes.

Zari mentioned that her performance was due to the energy drink she had before the show.

Unfortunately, Zari was unable to answer further questions because she had fallen asleep during our interview.
