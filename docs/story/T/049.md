# The Mountain

Junior sits in class on a Monday morning. Everyone takes **out** their notebooks.

- **Teacher**: Who wants to read their essay about what they did this weekend?

Junior raises his hand.

- **Junior**: I want to read my essay!

Junior stands up and begins to read.

- **Junior**: On Saturday morning, I climbed an enormous mountain. I woke up very early. It was very cold...
- **Girl**: Which mountain?
- **Junior**: Please wait until I'm done to ask questions. Thank you.
  - I was all alone, and it was still dark when I started to climb.
- **Boy**: Is this true?
- **Junior**: Yes, it's true, Andy. Be **quiet**. (Be ~~quite~~)
  - I climbed for an hour and then I sat down to rest. I could hear wild dogs barking nearby. I was scared they were going to find me and eat me.
- **Boy**: You really climbed for an hour?
- **Junior**: I'm very **athletic**.
  - I climbed so high that I started to feel weak. I was so hungry. I didn't have any food.
  - I didn't have a phone to call for help.
  - Just as I reached the top of the mountain, I fainted.
- **Teacher**: Wow, Junior. This is an incredible story. You have quite an imagination.
- **Junior**: I didn't imagine it.
- **Girl**: What happened next, Junior!?
- **Junior**: My dad opened the door.
- **Girl**: What?
- **Junior**: Dad said, "Junior, why are you sitting on that pile of clothes I just washed? It looks like a mountain."
  - Then he said, "You need to fold all of those clothes if you want pancakes."
- **Girl**: So, wait... the story is you had to fold some clothes before your dad made you pancakes?
- **Junior**: Yes — and it almost killed me.

## Writing

2. **“when I played it, there was sparks in it”**
   - → 语法错误，建议改为：
     - **“when I played with it, it made sparks”**
     - 或更自然的表达：**“that made sparks when I played with it.”**

I used to play with toys when I was a little kid. I still remember I had a toy gun that **made sparks** when I played with it.

> Accurate Version

I still remember I had a toy gun. When I **pulled the trigger**, it **made sparks** inside. It was one of my favorite toys as a kid.

我小时候常常玩玩具。我还记得我有一个玩具枪，每次玩它的时候里面会冒出火花。

| “玩具枪”         | **toy gun**                          | “toy guy” 不标准，听不出意思               |
| “玩的时候有火花” | **made sparks** / **sparked inside** | 英文中描述火花常用 “spark” 作为动词或名词  |
| “玩的时候”       | **when I pulled the trigger**        | 更具体地描述“玩”的动作，尤其是枪的使用方式 |

### Formal

I used to have a toy gun when I was a kid. When I pulled the trigger, it **made** small **sparks** **inside** the gun. The sparks were completely **contained**, so it was safe to play with. I really loved that toy.
