# The Refund

Lily is working at the clothing store.

- **Customer**: Excuse me, how much is this suit?
- **Lily**: Two hundred dollars. Do you want to try the suit on?
- **Customer**: No, I don't have time. Just take my money!

The man buys the suit. The next day, he returns to the store.

- **Customer**: Excuse me! I want a refund for this suit.
- **Lily**: Why? Is there a problem?
- **Customer**: This is not a black suit!
- **Lily**: You're right. That's a blue suit.
- **Customer**: I came here to buy a black suit.
- **Lily**: OK, so why did you buy a blue suit?
- **Customer**: Look at my family photo!

The man shows Lily his family photo.

- **Customer**: My wife is wearing a black dress in this photo. She told me to wear a black suit to match her dress!
- **Lily**: I'm sorry, dude. You can't return the suit if you **wore** it.
- **Customer**: I only wore the suit for an hour!
- **Lily**: Read the bottom of the receipt.

He reads the receipt.

- **Customer**: "No refunds if you wear the clothing."
  - But the suit didn't even fit me! It was so uncomfortable!
- **Lily**: Listen, I'm sorry. I can't give you a refund unless there was a problem. Like, if the suit was damaged ---
- **Customer**: I can get a refund if the suit is damaged? Well, fine! Look!

He tears the sleeve off the suit.

- **Lily**: Dude! That's not cool.
- **Customer**: I want my two hundred dollars back!

The store manager **runs over** to the **cash register**.

- **Manager**: What is the problem?
  - Oh! Sir, your suit looks damaged. Would you like a refund?
- **Customer**: Yes, please! Thank you so much, ma'am.
- **Manager**: Lily, we will talk about this later.
- **Lily**: I hate this job.

### In your opinion, who's right, Lily or the manager? Why?

I think Lily is right, she didn't do anything wrong. But the manager is also correct. Dealing with customers is not easy, Lily as a average employee, she doesn't have the permision to give a customer refund against store rules, but the manager can.

> Corrections:

1. "permission"
   - → better replaced with **"authority"** in this context, since we're talking about official power within a role.
2. The rest is mostly fine, with slight punctuation and fluency improvements.
