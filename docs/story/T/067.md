# The Secret Buyer - B2

Priti is visiting her husband, Vikram, at his bakery. Their friend Oscar's paintings are hanging on the walls.

- **Priti**: Vikram, can we talk about Oscar's weird death-themed paintings? They're scaring away customers.
- **Vikram**: I promised him I'd let him show his art here. Anyway, the paintings aren't that scary.

A customer enters the bakery, looks at the paintings, screams, and rushes out.

- **Priti**: See what I mean?! You need to get rid of them.
- **Vikram**: But I don't want to hurt Oscar's feelings.
- **Priti**: It'll hurt my feelings if you keep losing business.
- **Vikram**: OK, I promise I'll fix this.

Later, Oscar visits the bakery to see if anyone has bought his paintings. Looking through the crowded bakery, he sees that the walls are **bare**.

- **Oscar**: Hey ... who took my paintings off the wall?!
- **Vikram**: They've been sold — all of them!
- **Oscar**: Really? You're keeping me in **suspense** ... who bought them?!
- **Vikram**: The buyer ... wishes to remain anonymous.
- **Oscar**: I knew people loved my art! I'm going to start a new series of paintings for my next show immediately!

Oscar rushes out the door.

- **Priti**: I hope he doesn't think he's doing his next show here. By the way, who would want that many strange paintings?

Vikram laughs nervously.

- **Priti**: Well, as long as our customers don't have to look at them anymore, I'm happy.

That evening, when they open the front door to their apartment, Priti sees all the paintings from the bakery **stacked** in their living room.

- **Priti**: Vikram! You were the one who bought all of Oscar's paintings?
- **Vikram**: I wanted to make both of you happy! And ... art is a good investment!
- **Priti**: Let's discuss what we're going to do with them now, shall we?
- **Vikram**: I thought maybe we could hang them in the closet ...?

## Writing

### If you were Vikram, what would you have done with the paintings?

If I were Vikram, I **wouldn't** buy these paintings. **Respect** is mutual, if Oscar **forces** me to do something **that** **might** hurt myself, then I may stay away from him.

> Corrections:

1.  "hurt myself"

- → should be "hurt **me**" (because Oscar is the subject; "myself" is reflexive, but unnecessary here).

2.  "respect is mutual" would be clearer with a linking verb ("is" is fine, but the sentence could be restructured for flow).

If I were Vikram, I **wouldn't** buy these paintings. **Respect** is mutual**—**if Oscar **forces** me to do something that **might** hurt **me**, then I might choose to stay away from him.

如果我是 Vikram，我不会买这些画。尊重是相互的——如果 Oscar 强迫我做可能会伤害我的事情，那我可能会选择远离他。

### Rewrite Version

**If I were Vikram, I wouldn’t have bought those paintings. Respect should go both ways — if Oscar forces me to choose between our friendship and my business, I would rather step back from the relationship. It’s important to set healthy boundaries.**

如果我是 Vikram，我不会买那些画。尊重是相互的——如果 Oscar 强迫我在友情和生意之间做选择，我宁愿选择保持距离。建立健康的界限很重要。
