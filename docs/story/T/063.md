## The Rival - B2

At an art show, Oscar follows his friend Lucy reluctantly while she waves at her friends.

- **Oscar**: This gallery rejected my work! Why did you bring me here?
- **Lucy**: So you could meet other artists to inspire you.
- **Oscar**: Who could inspire me here? Every great artist needs a rival who pushes them to be better, but I'm the only great artist in this city.
- **Lucy**: Just enjoy the free food then.

Oscar walks to the **refreshments** table. A well-dressed woman approaches.

- **Oscar**: I wouldn't eat that cheese. It's terrible.
- **Woman**: A fellow cheese **connoisseur**! It's nice to meet someone else with good taste.
- **Oscar**: I'm Oscar. I'm an artist.
- **Woman**: I'm Kai. I'm an artist too. I can tell we'll be good friends.

Oscar looks around and shakes his head.

- **Oscar**: I really need to say something. This gallery ... It's terrible.
- **Woman**: Why do you say that?
- **Oscar**: Not only is the cheese bad, but the paintings are **hideous**!
  - It looks like a **raccoon** painted them!

Oscar laughs loudly. Kai, however, is silent.

- **Woman**: A raccoon painted some of them. Our show **features** animals who were trained to be artists!
- **Oscar**: What do you mean by "our" show?
- **Woman**: I own this gallery.
- **Oscar**: Oh ... Sorry ...
  - But I can't believe you would show paintings made by animals instead of my work!
  - I could create a painting in one night that would be better than anything here!
- **Woman**: Well, don't submit it here, because I'd never display your work!

Kai throws her wine in Oscar's face and leaves. Lucy runs to Oscar.

- **Lucy**: Oscar, are you OK?

Oscar is quiet as he wipes the wine off his face.

- **Oscar**: I'm thrilled!
  - Every great artist has a rival, and now I do too. Coming here was a great idea!

### Oscar has a new enemy! Do you have an enemy? How did that person become your enemy?

Yes, I have enemies. In reality, it is not always you act nice and people will become your friends. A lot of time, they just want to take more advantage. For those people, just act strict to them. We can only be nice to people who respect us.

Yes, I have enemies. In reality, it is not always **that** you act nice and people will become your friends. A lot of **times**, they just want to take advantage. For those people, just act strict **with** them. We can only be nice to people who respect us.

> Corrections:

1. “it is not always **that** you act nice and people will become your friends”
   - → awkward structure; 
   - should be rephrased for clarity.
2. “A lot of **times**”
   - → grammatically okay, but more natural phrasing is 
   - “A lot of **the time**” or “Often.”
3. “act strict **with** them”
   - → better phrased as 
   - “**be** strict **with** them” or “act firmly toward them.”

Yes, I have enemies. In reality, just **being nice** doesn’t always **mean** people will **become** your friends. A lot of **the time**, they just want to take advantage of you. **With** those people, **be strict**. We **should** only be kind to those who respect us.
