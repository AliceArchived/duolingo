Subject: Date Night Guidelines

Dear Grandma,

As you may remember, last week I had to camp outside due to the fact that your boyfriend came over to our apartment for a date.

To avoid any future issues, I'd like to create some guidelines:

1. On date nights, I will leave the apartment if you agree to provide money to cover my basic necessities for the evening. These expenses might include taxi rides, movie tickets, drinks at Koko's Karaoke Bar, or enough cash for at least twelve tacos.
2. If you or your date are cooking, then you should prepare an extra large serving for me. In cases where the date is at a restaurant that I like, then you must save **leftovers** for me.
3. I agree to drop you off at your date if you agree to lend me your car for the entire evening. You should be prepared to arrive twenty minutes to two hours late.

If I don't get a response from you regarding this email, then I will assume you have agreed to the above rules.

Thanks for your cooperation!

Your granddaughter,

Lin
