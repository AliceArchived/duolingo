# The Practice Date - B2

Bea is **comforting** her friend, Eddy, at his apartment while Eddy lies face down on the floor.

- **Bea**: You poor thing! I'm sorry your date never texted back.
- **Eddy**: And I did exactly what you said!
  - I'll be single forever!
- **Bea**: Don't worry, I have an idea! Let's have a practice date.
  - I'll teach you everything you need to know about dating.
- **Eddy**: Really? OK, let's go now!

Bea **frowns** at Eddy's **tracksuit**.

- **Bea**: Where's your suit?
- **Eddy**: I'd rather wear comfortable clothes.
- **Bea**: Do you want my help or not?

Later, Eddy and Bea are at a restaurant, and Eddy is wearing a dress shirt. He tries to loosen his tie.

- **Bea**: What do you talk about on dates?
- **Eddy**: Usually, I tell jokes. I've **memorized a bunch** of jokes from a book!
- **Bea**: Eddy, if you want to be charming, you can't repeat things from a book.
- **Eddy**: You're right, I should quote movies instead.
- **Bea**: No! Let's discuss something intellectual, like world affairs.
- **Eddy**: I'd rather talk about movies. I don't know anything about world affairs.
- **Bea**: You have to learn! Tell me what you think about the economy.
- **Eddy**: It's ... bad?
- **Bea**: OK ... that was hard. Here's an easy one. How do you feel about the latest unemployment rates?
- **Eddy**: This is too complicated! How can I find my soulmate when I'm in uncomfortable clothes talking about things I don't understand?

Eddy lays his head down on the table. Bea thinks for a moment.

- **Bea**: I'm sorry, Eddy. This must have been a really frustrating night. I was wrong. It's always more important to be yourself.
- **Eddy**: Yes. In this life, it's so hard to find a connection. We're all just floating through space, hoping to feel a little less alone. Beep beep boop.
- **Bea**: That's beautiful! The end was a little weird, though ... Did you just come up with that?
- **Eddy**: No, it's from my favorite movie, "Space Robots in Love"!

## Writing

### Do you agree with Bea's advice? Why or why not?

I don't agree with Bea's advice. If Eddy wants to find a solemate, he needs to act as what he is, not fakes to someone else.

I don't agree with Bea's advice. If Eddy wants to find a **soulmate**, he needs to act as what he is, not **fake** to someone else.

> Corrections:

1. "act as what he is" is awkward and unnatural in English.
   - Better: “be himself” or “act like himself.”
2. “not **fake** to someone else”
   - → “fake” is a verb here, and this phrasing is incorrect.
   - It should be “not **pretend to be someone else**” or “not **be fake**.”

I don't agree with Bea's advice. If Eddy wants to find a **soulmate**, he needs to **be himself**, not **pretend** to be someone else.
