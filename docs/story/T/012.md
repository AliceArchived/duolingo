# The Accident

Junior sees Lucy in their neighborhood.

- **Junior**: Hi, Lucy.

Lucy waves at Junior. She has a bandage on her foot.

- **Junior**: Why do you have a bandage on your foot?
- **Lucy**: I had an accident yesterday.
- **Junior**: An accident? What happened?
- **Lucy**: Well, I woke up in the morning and **made tea**.
  - And I dropped the pot of hot water.
- **Junior**: Did you burn your foot?
- **Lucy**: No, but the water spilled on the floor and the pot broke.
- **Junior**: Oh.
- **Lucy**: After that, I had to buy a new pot, so I got on my motorcycle. While I was riding, a cow walked into the road!
- **Junior**: Oh no! Did you hit the cow? Is that how you hurt your foot?
- **Lucy**: No, but I had to stop very quickly. I fell off my motorcycle!
- **Junior**: Oh, so that's how you hurt your foot!
- **Lucy**: No. After I **fell**, my motorcycle wasn't working, so I walked to find help.
  - And then a huge dog started running towards me.
- **Junior**: Did the dog bite you?
- **Lucy**: No, he was very friendly!
- **Junior**: OK...
- **Lucy**: Then a nice man saw me on the road and stopped to help me.
  - He was very handsome, so I asked him to go out with me.
- **Junior**: But how did you hurt your foot?!
- **Lucy**: He stepped on it! I'll never go dancing with him again.

Yesterday, I **made** shorts on QQQ — **an** index ETF for ~~Nasque~~ 100. It was a dramatic day in the US stock market history. In a single day, the index rose more than 10% and I was lucky to see all my shorts in the morning and buy it **at** a price I didn't even think it would be reached. But for the single bill, I still **lost** some money.

> Correction

1. made shorts on QQQ
   - → 更自然的表达是：**“shorted QQQ”** 或 **“made short trades on QQQ”**
   - “make shorts” 不是标准用法）
2. Nasque 100
   - → 拼写错误，应为：**Nasdaq 100**
3. “buy it at a price I didn't even think it would ~~be reached~~”
   - → 语序不自然，可改为：**“buy it back at a price I never thought it would reach”**
   - （更清楚地表达“没想到它会跌到那个价位”）
4. “the single bill”
   - → 表达不清晰，不明确你指的是什么。可能你是想说某一笔交易（a single position / a specific trade）
   - 建议：**“But on one trade, I still lost some money.”**

Yesterday, I **shorted** QQQ, **an** index ETF for the **Nasdaq** 100. It was a dramatic day in U.S. stock market history—the index rose more than 10% in a single day. Luckily, I **closed** my short **positions** in the morning and **bought it back** at a price I never thought it would **reach**. But on one trade, I still ended up losing some money.

昨天我做空了 QQQ，这是追踪纳斯达克 100 指数的 ETF。这一天在美国股市历史上非常戏剧性——指数单日上涨超过 10%。幸运的是，我在早上就平掉了所有空头头寸，并在一个我原本不认为会达到的价格回补了它。但在其中一笔交易中，我还是亏了一些钱。

Yesterday, I went shopping with a friend. We met at a ~~buffi~~, and we ate some food first. Then it was raining, so we ~~mingled~~ the mall first. After that, we were going to take a bus, but the bus was so late, we needed to wait for about an hour, so we took a taxi to the supermarket.

> Correction

1. **buffi**
   - → 拼写错误，应为 **buffet**（自助餐厅）
2. we ~~mingled~~ the mall first → 用词错误
   - **mingle** 通常指“人与人之间的社交”，不适合这里
   - 应改为 “**we walked around the mall**” 或 “**we spent some time in the mall**”
3. we were going to take a bus, but the bus was so late
   - → 表达累赘，可更自然地说 “we planned to take the bus, but it was really late”
4. we needed to wait
   - → 更地道的说法是 “we had to wait”

Yesterday, I went shopping with a friend. We met at a **buffet** and had some food first. Then it **started** raining, so we **walked around** the mall for a while. After that, we **planned** to take the bus, but **it was so late that** we **had to wait** for about an hour — so we decided to take a taxi to the supermarket instead.

昨天我和一个朋友去逛街。我们在一家自助餐厅碰面，先吃了点东西。后来下起了雨，于是我们先在商场里逛了逛。之后我们本来打算坐公交车，但车太晚了，我们等了大约一个小时，最后决定打车去超市。

### 雅思口语 Part 2 范文：

**Describe a recent day when you stayed at home and what you did.**

Well, yesterday was actually a pretty meaningful day for me, even though I stayed at home most of the time. I’ve just graduated recently, so I’m in that **transition period** where I need to plan the next stage of my life.

In the morning, I made myself a cup of coffee and sat down to create a new daily schedule. I want to stay **productive**, even though I’m not a student anymore. I spent a couple of hours organizing my time — including study goals, job searching, and even some time for hobbies.

After that, I studied for a while, mainly reviewing some English materials. In the afternoon, I felt like I needed some fresh air, so I went for a walk by the riverside near my home. It was quiet and peaceful, which really helped me clear my head and feel more relaxed.

Overall, it wasn’t **a very eventful day**, but it felt satisfying because I used my time well and took a small step toward my future.

昨天对我来说其实是很有意义的一天，尽管我大部分时间都待在家里。我刚刚毕业，现在正处于一个过渡阶段，需要计划下一步的生活。

早上我泡了一杯咖啡，然后开始制定新的日常作息表。我希望自己即使不再是学生，也能保持高效。我花了几个小时安排学习目标、找工作的时间，甚至还规划了兴趣爱好。

之后我学习了一会儿，主要是复习一些英语内容。下午我觉得需要呼吸一下新鲜空气，就去了家附近的河边散步。那里的环境很安静，也让我放松下来、理清了思绪。

整体来说，这一天虽然不算特别精彩，但我觉得很充实，因为我很好地利用了时间，也向未来迈出了一小步。

### 口语化版本：

Oh, yesterday? I didn’t really go out — I just stayed at home. I recently graduated, so I’m kind of trying to figure out what to do next. In the morning, I made a rough schedule for myself — you know, just something to help me stay on track and not waste too much time.

I studied for a bit, mostly some English stuff, and later in the afternoon I went for a walk by the riverside near my place. It was pretty quiet and peaceful, and honestly, it helped me relax and clear my head.

So yeah, nothing super exciting, but it felt like a good balance of getting things done and taking a break.

哦，你是说昨天吗？我其实没有出门，就待在家。我最近刚毕业，现在还在摸索下一步该干嘛。早上我给自己列了个大致的计划，想让自己别太混日子。

然后我学了一会儿，大多是英语。下午的时候去家附近的河边散了个步，那里挺安静的，说实话挺放松的，也让我理清了一些想法。

所以虽然不是特别刺激的一天，但感觉挺不错的，有效率也有休息。

## Sentences

  - Comment: While grammatically fine, the phrase "And I dropped..." would sound a little more natural if you **remove the “And”** or connect the sentence smoothly.
