# The Worst Season

Oscar and Vikram are waiting for a bus.

Oscar **sneezes**.

- **Oscar**: Ugh. I have very bad **allergies** right now.
- **Vikram**: Yeah, your eyes look really red!
- **Oscar**: I always feel terrible during spring.
- **Vikram**: Well, summer will be here soon.
- **Oscar**: Why is that a good thing?
- **Vikram**: Because then you won't have allergies anymore.

- **Oscar**: But summer is so hot.
  - I hate seeing everyone wear shorts.
- **Vikram**: OK. Then you probably like fall!
- **Oscar**: Definitely not.
- **Vikram**: Why?
- **Oscar**: Fall is the worst season.
  - I'm a teacher! I have to go back to work again in fall.
- **Vikram**: Well, do you like winter?
- **Oscar**: Winter is the worst season.
- **Vikram**: You just said fall is the worst season.
- **Oscar**: Winter is freezing.
  - And the weather makes my skin so dry!
- **Vikram**: Oscar, do you like any part of the year?
- **Oscar**: New Year's Eve is OK.
- **Vikram**: Great! Why do you like New Year's Eve?
- **Oscar**: Because on New Year's Eve another terrible year is finally over.

## Writing

### In your opinion, what is the worst season? Why?

The worst season is winter. I don't like ~~the weather too cold~~. In winter, I can't stay outside long, so ~~I'll~~ do **fewer** activities.

> Corrections:

1. "I don't like the weather too cold."
   - → 语法不通顺，应改为 “I don't like **very cold weather**” 或 “I don't like it when the weather is too cold.”
2. “so I'll do fewer activities” 虽不算错，但 “I'll” 更适合用于未来时，这里是陈述一种普遍事实，改为 “**I do fewer activities**” 更自然。

The worst season is winter. I don't like **it when** the weather is too cold. In winter, I can't stay outside for long, so **I do** fewer activities.

我最讨厌的季节是冬天。我不喜欢天气太冷。冬天我无法在户外待太久，所以活动也少了很多。

You **cannot** say "do less activities" because **“activities”** is a **countable noun**, and “less” is used with **uncountable nouns**.

- **fewer activities** ✅（因为 “activities” 是可数的）
- **less time**, **less money**, **less noise** ✅（这些是不可数）

The worst season is winter. I don't really like winter because the weather is too cold here. During this season I ~~hardly do any outdoor activities, and I just stay at home~~. Actually, meeting people makes me feel good, feel alive.

> Corrections:

1. **“hardly do any outdoor activities, and I just stay at home.”**
   - 虽然可以理解，但更自然的表达是：**“I hardly do any outdoor activities and usually just stay at home.”**
2. - “meeting people makes me feel good, feel alive.”
   - ✔️ 语法上可接受，但为了更流畅自然，建议稍作润色，例如：
     - ✅ **“Meeting people makes me feel good and alive.”** 或
     - ✅ **“Seeing people lifts my mood and reminds me I’m alive.”**

The worst season is winter. I don't really like it because the weather is too cold here. During this season, I **hardly do any outdoor activities and usually just stay at home**. But meeting people makes me **feel good and alive**, so winter feels a bit **isolating**.

我最不喜欢的季节是冬天。我真的不喜欢这里的寒冷天气。这个季节我几乎不进行任何户外活动，通常只是待在家里。但见到人会让我感觉很好，感觉有活力，所以冬天让我觉得有点孤独。

The worst season is winter. It's freezing, it gets dark way too early, and stepping outside feels like a punishment. I can’t go biking, walking, or even enjoy a **decent** ice cream without turning into a popsicle. So I end up staying indoors like **a hibernating bear**, doing fewer activities and counting down the days until spring.

我最讨厌的季节是冬天。天气冷得要命，天黑得又早，一出门就像被惩罚一样。我不能骑车、散步，连吃个冰淇淋都像要变成冰棍。结果我就像只冬眠的熊一样窝在屋里，活动变少，只能一天天等着春天的到来。
