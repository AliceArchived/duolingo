# The Frog

Junior sees his classmate, Betsy, hiding a frog in their teacher's desk.

- **Junior**: Betsy, what are you doing?
- **Betsy**: I'm going to scare our teacher.
  - He'll love it! It will be a funny **prank**.
- **Junior**: I love pranks! I didn't realize you love them too.
- **Betsy**: Don't tell him, OK?
- **Junior**: Don't worry. I won't.

Later, their teacher sits down at his desk.

When he opens his drawer, the frog jumps out.

- **Teacher**: Ahhhhh!

All of the kids in the class laugh.

The frog jumps onto Betsy's desk, and Junior catches it.

- **Teacher**: This is not funny! Everyone, **sit** down!

No one sit**s** down.

- **Teacher**: Who did this? Who put this frog inside my desk?!

The class **becomes** very quiet.

- **Teacher**: Class, if no one tells me, then I will have to punish the whole class.

Junior raises his hand and looks at Betsy.

- **Junior**: I'll tell you who did it.

Everyone looks at Junior. Betsy looks worried.

- **Betsy**: Junior! Please, don't ..
- **Junior**: I put the frog inside your desk.

Junior smiles **at** Betsy.

- **Junior**: I love frogs. Don't you?

Junior picks up the frog and kisses it.

- **Teacher**: Junior, you're **in a lot of trouble**! I'm going to call your dad right now.
- **Junior**: I don't mind.

The teacher leaves the classroom.

- **Betsy**: Thanks, Junior. That was very brave. You know, you're pretty cool!
- **Junior**: No problem! So … do you maybe want to be my girlfriend?
- **Betsy**: Ew! No. You kissed a frog.

## Writing

### In this story, Betsy tells Junior that he is very brave. Describe the personality of someone in your family or of a friend.

My uncle isn't brave. Actually, he is the opposite. **On the** outside, he listens **to** what everybody says and easily **believes them**; but in the family he wants to **be** in charge. **However**, he can't take responsibility. And if things go wrong, he always **blames** other people.

> Corrections:

1. “On the outside”

- → 更自然的表达是 “On the surface” 或 “Outwardly”

2. “he listens to what everybody says and easily believes them”

- → “them” 指代不清，可优化为 “believes whatever people say”

3. “he wants to be in charge”

- → 语法正确，但可配合语境加强表达

4. “However” 开头没问题，但语气连接稍显突兀，

- 可用 “The problem is,” 或 “The issue is,” 更自然

5. 语气整体较负面，可稍作润色以避免显得过于刻薄，增强表达的平衡性和逻辑性

My uncle isn't very brave — in fact, he's quite the opposite. **Outwardly**, he **seems** to agree with whatever people say and **tends** to believe them easily. But **within the family**, he always **wants** to be the one in control.

The issue is, he often **avoids** taking real responsibility. When things go wrong, instead of **reflecting on his own actions**, he **tends** to blame others. He prefers being in charge, but he struggles to handle the consequences that come with leadership.

我叔叔不是很有勇气——事实上，恰恰相反。在外人面前，他总是随声附和，轻易相信别人说的话。但在家里，他总是想掌控一切。

问题在于，他常常不愿意承担真正的责任。一旦事情出错，他往往不会反思自己，而是责怪他人。他喜欢主导，但却难以承担当领导应有的后果。
