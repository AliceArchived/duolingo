# The Lonely Frog - B2

Eddy **rushes around** the apartment with a broom, cleaning as fast as he can. He enters the kitchen to find the sink filled with frogs.

- **Eddy**: Junior! My date is coming over soon! Why are there dozens of frogs in our sink?!

A frog jumps onto Eddy's head, causing Eddy to scream. Junior walks in and calmly removes the frog.

- **Junior**: I caught them outside this morning. I'm trying to help my frog, Sugar, meet other frogs so she can find a **companion**. She's **lonely**.
- **Eddy**: Fine. Keep a few frogs and take the rest outside while I get ready.

Junior follows Eddy to his bedroom. When Eddy tries to put on a more formal pair of pants, a frog jumps out of the pant leg.

- **Eddy**: Junior! This is unacceptable! There are too many frogs.
- **Junior**: **There's no such thing as too many frogs,** Dad.
- **Eddy**: Please take them back outside!
- **Junior**: Just cancel the date. We can have a nice night at home with the frogs.

Eddy **sighs** and sits down with Junior.

- **Eddy**: Junior, Sugar's lonely, right? Well, I'm lonely too. And I'm trying to find the right **companion**.
  - Don't you want me to be happy?
- **Junior**: Of course. Why didn't you just say that **in the first place**? Let's clean this place up.

Later, Eddy's date arrives. The apartment is **spotless**, and Eddy looks exhausted.

- **Eddy**: Junior, meet Angela.
- **Angela**: Hi, Junior! Your dad mentioned you love frogs, so I brought you a surprise.

Angela hands Junior a small tank with a frog in it.

- **Junior**: Wow, thanks! I'll put him with the others!

Junior takes the frog and opens the bathroom door. Dozens of frogs jump out. Angela looks horrified.

- **Eddy**: Uhh.. You know what they say ... There's no such thing as too many frogs!

## Writing

### Do you think Junior will get along with Angela? Why or why not?

I don't think that Junior will get along with Angela. Junior ~~have~~ too many frogs. Sure, Angela was trying to get along with Junior by taking him a frog as a gift, but not that ~~much~~ frogs.

I don't think that Junior will get along with Angela. Junior **has** too many frogs. Sure, Angela was trying to get along with Junior by **giving** him **a** frog as a gift, but not that **many** frogs.

I don't think that Junior will get along with Angela. Junior **has** a lot of frogs, but Angela didn’t know that. She gave him one as a gift to try to get along with him, but then she found out he already had so **many**. If Angela ends up living with Junior, I can’t imagine she’d be happy surrounded by that **many** frogs.

---

I think that Junior will not **get** along with Angela. Yes, Angela is trying to be nice to Junior, but Junior has too many frogs. They are annoying in real life. I don't think any normal ~~people~~ could stand with that.

> Corrections:

- “any normal people could stand with that”
  - “people” 是复数，不能和 “any” 搭配这种单一情境。
  - “stand with that” 是中文直译，不自然。
  - ✅ 建议改为：
    - **“any normal person could put up with that”** 或
    - **“anyone normal could tolerate that”**
- “stand with”
  > - 通常表示“站在一起、支持”，而不是“忍受”。你这里想表达的是“忍受”，应使用：
  - **put up with**（忍受）
  - **tolerate**（容忍）
  - **deal with**（应对）

I don’t think Junior will get along with Angela. **Even though** Angela is trying to be nice, Junior has **way too many** frogs **—and** they’re really annoying in real life. I don’t think any normal **person** could **put up with** that.

我觉得 Junior 不会和 Angela 合得来。虽然 Angela 想对他好，但 Junior 有太多青蛙了——在现实中真的很烦人。我不觉得任何一个正常人能忍受那种情况。

### Rewrite Version

I think Junior might **actually** get along with Angela. **Even though** she looked shocked at first when the frogs jumped out, she brought a frog as a gift for Junior, which shows she was trying to connect with him. Since Junior loves frogs, and Angela made the effort to understand that, they could become friends—if she can get used to all those frogs.

我觉得 Junior 可能真的能和 Angela 合得来。虽然刚开始青蛙跳出来时她很震惊，但她送给 Junior 一只青蛙作为礼物，这说明她试图和他建立联系。既然 Junior 喜欢青蛙，而 Angela 又愿意去了解他，他们可能会成为朋友——如果她能适应那一大堆青蛙的话。

I don't think Junior will get along with Angela. **Even though** she's trying to be nice, Junior has way too many frogs. **Most people** would find that **annoying** or **overwhelming**. Angela looked horrified when she saw all the frogs, so I doubt she’ll want to spend more time with him.

我认为 Junior 不会和 Angela 合得来。尽管她试图表现得友善，但 Junior 实在有太多青蛙了，一般人都会觉得烦或者受不了。当 Angela 看到那么多青蛙时，脸上的表情都吓坏了，我觉得她大概不太愿意再和 Junior 相处了。
