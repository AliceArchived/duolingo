# The New Oven

Vikram arrives at his bakery and sees his employee Lin cleaning an old, **rusty** oven. She smiles proudly when she sees Vikram.

- **Vikram**: What's this? You were supposed to buy a new oven to replace the one you broke yesterday. This is a used oven.
- **Lin**: It's used, but it still works! And it was $500 cheaper than a new oven.
  - We can use the money I saved to buy a TV. Then I can watch movies at work.
- **Vikram**: But it smells awful!
- **Lin**: I'm still cleaning it. Trust me, this was a great deal.

Later that day, Lin is baking **cupcakes** in the kitchen when Vikram enters.

- **Vikram**: Lin, this oven is making the whole bakery smell like fish!
- **Lin**: It's not that bad.

Suddenly, a stray cat jumps onto the counter.

- **Vikram**: The smell is **attracting** **stray cats**!
- **Lin**: They just like the smell of your delicious cupcakes.

Five more cats enter the kitchen.

- **Lin**: Actually, this is great. We can finally start a cat cafe!
  - We'll make even more money **in addition to** the $500 I already saved.
- **Vikram**: Lin, we're not starting a cat cafe. Please just clean the oven again. I'll get the cats out of here.
- **Lin**: Fine.

As Vikram tries to catch the cats, Lin **sprays** **air freshener** into the oven.

- **Vikram**: Be careful. The oven is still on!

Suddenly, a fire starts inside the oven.

- **Vikram**: Oh no!

Vikram rushes to get the **fire extinguisher** and quickly puts out the fire.

Later, Lin and Vikram watch as a repairman **inspects** the oven.

- **Man**: The fire damaged the inside of the oven, and it needs a new door.
- **Vikram**: Can you fix it?
- **Man**: Of course. It will cost $1000.
- **Lin**: It's a good thing I saved us that $500!

## Writing

### Do you think Lin really saved Vikram some money? Why or why not?

No, I don't think Lin actually saved any money ~~at last~~.at last. When she buying the old oven, it was $500 cheaper, but the oven was broken when she cleaned it. And to fix it, it will cost $1000, minus the lower price, the total cost is $500 more than buying a new oven directly.

No, I don't think Lin actually saved any money **in the end**. When she **was** buying the old oven, it was $500 cheaper, but the oven was broken when she cleaned it. And to fix it, it will cost $1000, minus the lower price, the total cost is $500 more than **buying** a new oven directly.

> Corrections:

1. “minus the lower price”
   - → unclear and awkward; better as “even after subtracting the $500 she saved”
2. “more than buying a new oven directly”
   - → understandable but a little awkward. More natural: “more than just buying a new oven in the first place.”

### Revised

> 🌟 IELTS Band 7–8 level

No, I don’t think Lin actually saved any money in the end. When she **bought** the old oven, it was $500 cheaper, but the oven was damaged after she cleaned it. **Fixing** it will cost $1000. **Even after subtracting** the $500 she **initially** saved, it still **ends up** costing $500 more than **just** buying a new oven **in the first place**.

不，我认为林最后其实没有省下任何钱。她买的旧烤箱虽然便宜了 500 美元，但在清洁过程中却损坏了。修理费用是 1000 美元。即使减去她省下的那 500 美元，整体花费也比一开始直接买个新烤箱还贵了 500 美元。

### Story

In the story, Lin purchases a used oven for the bakery, claiming it was $500 cheaper than a new one. However, the oven emits a strong fishy smell, attracting stray cats into the bakery. When Lin attempts to mask the odor with air freshener while the oven is still on, it catches fire. A repairman later informs them that fixing the oven will cost $1,000, effectively negating any initial savings.

Therefore, Lin's attempt to save money by buying a used oven ultimately results in higher expenses due to repair costs and the complications caused by the oven's condition.
