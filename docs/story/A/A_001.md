# A Big Commitment

Dear Elise,

Although I appreciate you asking me out, I couldn't possibly be your boyfriend. While I wish I could, we're both only eight years old.

And although I can do a lot of adult things, like order pizza with my dad's credit card, there's no way I'm ready for this kind of commitment.

I know I said yes in the moment, but that's only because you offered me a cookie, and I make bad decisions when I'm hungry.

At this age, we need to focus on ourselves. I saw the skateboarding alien you drew instead of taking notes in math class, and I think having a boyfriend would distract you from a successful career illustrating comic books.

Besides, as I've learned from my dad, dating only leads to heartbreak.

You have no idea how many times I've caught him eating all my ice cream after a difficult breakup.

But most importantly, my heart already belongs to someone else — my **neighbor**, Lily. She's in love with me, too. It might just take her ten years to realize it.

In conclusion, I'm not interested in dating anyone ... except Lily.

Sorry,

Junior

### Writing

#### What do you think of Junior's reasons for not dating Elise? Why?

It seems to me that he is still a **kid**. But it is good for him to refuse someone if he doesn't like them. And for **that** reason, I keep my opinion to myself.

> 1. “he is still a **kid**” → added “**just**” for emphasis and smoother tone
> 2. “if he doesn’t like them” → softened to “if he doesn’t feel the same” (more polite)
>    “for **that** reason” → kept but rephrased the second sentence for flow

#### Polished Version:

It seems to me that Junior is still **just** a **kid**, which makes sense. But it's good that he knows how to politely refuse someone if he doesn’t feel the same. **For that reason**, I respect his decision and prefer to keep my opinion to myself.
