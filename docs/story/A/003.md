### Writing

#### Lin's parents had a fancy wedding. Do you like fancy events? Why or why not?

Yes, I like fancy events. Our daily life is plain, we need some special moments. Let's add some color **to** our life.

> - “Our daily life is plain” → 语法上可以接受，但表达略显单薄
> - “we need some special moments” → 句子结构可以更自然
> - “Let’s add some color in our life.” → 应为 “add some color **to** our life”（介词错误）

Yes, I like fancy events. **Everyday life** can be **quite ordinary**, so I think we all need some special moments **from time to time**. They bring excitement and help us create lasting memories. It’s a great way to add some color to our lives.

是的，我喜欢隆重的活动。日常生活往往很平淡，所以我觉得我们都需要一些特别的时刻。这些时刻带来兴奋感，也帮助我们留下美好的回忆。这是为生活增添色彩的好方式。
