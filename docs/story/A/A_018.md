# Art Camp - B2

Lily is sitting under a tree at a summer camp for artists. Suddenly, she feels a tap on her shoulder. It's her best friend, Zari.

- **Lily**: Zari? Why are you here?
- **Zari**: I missed you, so I came to visit! You don't have a new best friend already, do you?
- **Lily**: Of course not.
  - So ... when are you planning on going home?
- **Zari**: I just got here, and you already want me to go home?
- **Lily**: I was just curious ... Anyway, I'm hungry. Let's get lunch.

Lily and Zari arrive at the cafeteria.

- **Zari**: Let's sit over there!

Zari waves to a table of kids as Lily looks around nervously.

- **Lily**: Uhh ... no. I was going to eat in the painting studio.
- **Zari**: Don't you want to introduce me to your friends?
- **Lily**: They seem busy.
- **Zari**: OK ...

When Lily and Zari arrive at the studio, they see a few kids inside. Lily quickly turns away.

- **Lily**: Actually, I'd rather eat in my room.
- **Zari**: But I want to meet your friends!
- **Lily**: That's not going to happen.
- **Zari**: Lily, I came here to see you, but you don't want to introduce me to anyone!
  - Are you embarrassed of me because I'm not a cool artist like you and your new friends?
- **Lily**: I wasn't planning to tell you this ... but I don't have any friends here. Everyone is cooler and more talented than I am.
- **Zari**: Lily, you're the coolest person I know.
- **Lily**: You must not know many people ... But thanks. Come on, let's go to the cafeteria.

As Lily walks ahead, a group of kids run up to Zari.

- **Boy**: You know that girl?! She hasn't spoken to anyone all summer. She's so mysterious and cool.
- **Zari**: Yeah, but just so you know, she already has a best friend.
