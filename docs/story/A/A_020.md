# Astronaut Camp

Zari and Lily walk toward the entrance of a summer camp. They see a sign that says "JJ's Astronaut Adventures."

- **Zari**: We're finally at astronaut camp! This is going to be the best summer ever!
- **Lily**: I'd rather be home watching TV. This is going to be the worst summer ever.
- **Zari**: Lily, our generation will be the first to go to Mars! We need to learn how to be astronauts.

The owner of the camp, JJ, overhears their conversation.

- **JJ**: Actually, because of a lawsuit, we're not allowed to tell campers that we're training them to be astronauts.
- **Zari**: Oh... but we'll still learn about what it's like to go to space, right?
- **JJ**: Yes! You'll learn what it's like in space by bouncing on our zero gravity training device!

JJ points to a nearby trampoline.

- **Lily**: That's a broken trampoline.
- **Zari**: Lily, don't be rude! I'm sure they're fixing it.
- **JJ**: Uhh... Yeah, sure.
- **Zari**: So, when will we meet a real astronaut?
- **JJ**: Actually, the astronaut is going to a different space-themed camp that is willing to pay her.
  - But we have other fun activities!

JJ takes them to a muddy field.

- **JJ**: This field is basically the same as the atmosphere on Mars! Tomorrow, you'll spend the whole day here, digging up space rocks.
- **Lily**: Is digging up rocks really what astronauts would do on Mars?
- **JJ**: That's all there is to do on Mars.

Zari **nods**, and they continue walking.

- **JJ**: Welcome to your spaceships, where you'll be sleeping all summer!
- **Lily**: These are just cheap tents.
- **Zari**: This will teach us about becoming astronauts, right?
- **JJ**: Right! It'll be just like living on Mars because there's no plumbing!
- **Zari**: No plumbing?! How will we take showers?
- **JJ**: You won't! Because ...
- **Lily**: Let me guess... astronauts don't shower?
- **Zari**: You were right, Lily. We can learn about space by watching "Space Viking" movies. Let's go home.
- **JJ**: You can leave, but you'll miss the greatest summer of your lives!
  - Also, refunds aren't allowed.

### Writing

#### In your opinion, what is the best way to spend the summer? Why?

In my opinion, for a holiday, it's better to relax. But for kids, they can do some things both fun and educational **activities**. **A summer camp** is a good idea. There are lots of camps. Choose what your kids like.

> - “do some things both fun and educational activities” is awkward and redundant. It should be simplified.
> - “A summer camp” should be integrated smoothly into the sentence.
> - “Choose what your kids like” is too abrupt.

In my opinion, holidays are better spent relaxing. But for kids, it’s great if they can do **activities** that are both fun and educational. A summer camp is a good idea — there are many **to choose from**, so pick one that matches your kids’ interests.

## 在我看来，假期最好是用来放松的。但对孩子来说，参加一些既有趣又有教育意义的活动是很不错的选择。夏令营就是一个好主意——有很多不同类型的营地，可以根据孩子的兴趣来选择。
