# Eddy's Parenting Book - B2

Eddy walks into his son Junior's bedroom, stepping over piles of toys and clothes.

- **Eddy**: Look at this mess, Junior! According to the parenting book I've been reading, it's very important for children to clean their rooms. It's the first step to **being** successful in life.
- **Junior**: Why do you care about what a book says?
- **Eddy**: The author was a tough parent, and his daughter grew up to cure two diseases. Most people never even cure one!
  - That's why I'm going to be in charge from now on, Junior.
- **Junior**: I'll make my bed if you get us pizza for dinner.

Eddy opens his parenting book.

- **Eddy**: The book doesn't say anything about pizza, so I guess that's OK.
- **Junior**: And I'll clean the whole room if we can get ice cream afterward.
- **Eddy**: Alright. I want ice cream too, so I'm technically still in charge of this situation.

Eddy turns to another chapter in his book.

- **Eddy**: The book also says that it's important for you to help with chores.
  - So please take out the trash.
- **Junior**: Hmm ... I'll do it if I can make a pond with dirt and rocks for my pet frog.
- **Eddy**: Junior, we've talked about this. No more ponds in the bathtub.
- **Junior**: Fine then, I won't take out the trash.

Eddy desperately looks through the book.

- **Eddy**: Oh no, the book definitely doesn't say anything about frogs!
- **Junior**: Then we have a deal!

An hour later, Eddy brings Junior pizza and ice cream while Junior's frog swims in the dirt-filled bathtub.

- **Junior**: Thanks, Dad! You did everything I asked.
- **Eddy**: I was supposed to be in charge. How did this happen?
- **Junior**: When you got that book on parenting at the library, I also got a book. It's about how to persuade people.
