# Eddy's Meeting

Eddy is meeting with his son Junior's teacher. He sits down and looks nervous.

- **Teacher**: Thank you for coming in. We really need to talk.
- **Eddy**: What did Junior do? Has he been hiding under his desk and eating candy again?
- **Teacher**: No, that's not why I called you —
- **Eddy**: Oh no. Did he bring frogs to class in his backpack again?
- **Teacher**: Well, yes, but that's not why I called you.
- **Eddy**: Oh. Then, what is the problem?
- **Teacher**: We need to talk about Junior's homework.
- **Eddy**: Ah. I understand.
  - I've been trying to help Junior with his homework more often.
- **Teacher**: Well, this week —
- **Eddy**: Actually, this week I helped him with his science project!
- **Teacher**: Oh, you helped him with his project?
- **Eddy**: Yes! I helped him because I know a lot about **dinosaurs**.
- **Teacher**: You do?
- **Eddy**: Yes. I've seen every dinosaur movie.
- **Teacher**: Ah. Well, Junior's homework is usually very good...
- **Eddy**: That's great!
- **Teacher**: But this dinosaur project was terrible.
  - A lot of the information was wrong.
  - For example, humans did not ride dinosaurs.
- **Eddy**: Oh ... right, I knew that.
- **Teacher**: Also, dinosaurs could not run faster than cars.
- **Eddy**: Really?
- **Teacher**: Maybe you should let Junior do the research next time.

## Writing

### Eddy tried to help Junior with his homework. Do you think that was a good idea?

No, I don't think that's a good idea. Eddy did the science project according to movies he watched. He has no idea what he was doing.

> Corrections:

1. **“that's a good idea”**
   - → 时态错误，应为过去时 **“that was a good idea”**
2. **“according to movies he watched”**
   - → 更自然地表达为 **“based on movies he had watched”**，符合过去完成时逻辑
3. **“he has no idea”**
   - → 时态错误，应为过去时 **“he had no idea”**

No, I do not think that was a good idea. Eddy did the science project based on movies he had watched. He had no idea what he was doing.

不，我认为那不是一个好主意。Eddy 是根据他看过的电影来做科学项目的，他根本不知道自己在做什么。

No, I think it was a bad idea. Eddy doesn't have good knowledge and he **didn't** check the information. Plus, Junior should do **his** homework by himself; it is **the** parent's **responsibility**.

> Corrections:

1. “Eddy doesn't have good knowledge”
   - → awkward phrasing; better as
   - **“Eddy doesn’t know the subject well”** or
   - **“Eddy lacks knowledge in that area.”**
2. “it is **the** parent's **responsibility**”
   - → should be **“it’s the parents’ responsibility”** (plural possessive, unless referring to a single parent).

No, I think it was a bad idea. Eddy **lacks knowledge** in that area and **didn’t** check the information. Plus, Junior should do his homework by himself — it’s the parents’ responsibility **to support**, not replace him.

### 🌟 Polished

No, I do not think it was a good idea. Eddy helped Junior with his science project, but he used information from dinosaur movies instead of real research. As a result, the project was full of mistakes, like saying humans rode dinosaurs. Eddy clearly did not know what he was doing.

不，我认为那不是一个好主意。Eddy 帮 Junior 做科学项目时，用的是恐龙电影里的内容，而不是查资料。结果这个项目错误百出，比如说人类骑恐龙。很明显，Eddy 根本不知道自己在做什么。
