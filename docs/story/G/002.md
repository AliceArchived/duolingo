# Get Out!

Lin and Lucy are walking down the street when it starts to rain.

- **Lin**: Let's go to a coffee shop to **get out of the rain**. How about this one?
- **Lucy**: Oh, not that one.

They continue walking.

- **Lin**: Oh, this one looks good!
- **Lucy**: We can't go there either.
- **Lin**: What about the one next door?
- **Lucy**: Definitely not.
- **Lin**: What's wrong with all these coffee shops?
- **Lucy**: Well... I'm not allowed to go inside any of them.
- **Lin**: Are you serious? We're **getting really wet**.

Frustrated, Lin walks into the closest coffee shop. Lucy follows her.

- **Man**: Get out of here, Lucy!

They quickly leave.

- **Lucy**: He's mad because I illegally downloaded movies using the cafe Wi-Fi connection.
- **Lin**: OK, let's go to the restaurant next door.

They walk in, and the waiter **bursts** into tears.

- **Waiter**: Lucy! How could you come here after you broke my heart?!
- **Lucy**: Sorry, Francois. I've got to run!

They rush out of the restaurant.

- **Lin**: What about this bakery?

The owner at the bakery looks at Lucy angrily.

- **Lucy**: Hi, Ron...
- **Ron**: Get out!
- **Lucy**: Sorry I took all your money in that **poker game**. We'll leave.
- **Lin**: You're making it impossible for us to get out of the rain in this neighborhood!
- **Lucy**: Oh! There's a **deli** across the street.
- **Lin**: And you're still allowed in there?
- **Lucy**: Yes! The owner loves me. I taught him all about cryptocurrency. He'll give us free coffee.
- **Lin**: Great!

Later, after the rain stops, they walk to the park with their coffees.

- **Lin**: Why don't we sit there, next to the violin player?

The violin player sees Lucy.

- **Man**: Hey! I told you I never wanted to see you here again!
- **Lin**: What did you do to that guy?!
- **Lucy**: Don't ask.

## Writing

### Lucy is very mysterious. What do you think happened between her and the violinist? Why?

I think that Lucy may **have made** some comments on the violinist. But her comments may **have had** some errors, **which is** why the violinist is so angry and Lucy doesn't want to talk about it.

> Corrections:

1. “**which is** why”
   - → slightly awkward here. Better phrased as **"which might be why"** for tone consistency.
2. Slight repetition of “may have”
   - — stylistically fine, but could be made smoother.

I think that Lucy **may have made** some comments about the **violinist**. But her comments **might have had** some errors, which **might** be why the violinist is so angry and Lucy doesn't want to talk about it.

我觉得 Lucy 可能对那位小提琴家发表了一些评论。但她的评论可能有些错误，这也许就是小提琴家非常生气、而 Lucy 又不愿意谈这件事的原因。

I think that Lucy may **have disturbed** the violinist's playing before. The violinist was angry with Lucy, so something bad **happened to** the violinist before.

> Corrections:

- "so something bad **happened to** the violinist before" is grammatically okay, but the logic is unclear — it's better to clarify the cause-effect or rephrase for coherence.

I think that Lucy may **have disturbed** the violinist’s playing before. The **violinist** was angry with Lucy, so **perhaps something bad had happened to him because of her earlier**.
