Eddy helped Junior with his science project, but he used information from dinosaur movies instead of real research. As a result, the project was full of mistakes, like saying humans rode dinosaurs. Eddy clearly did not know what he was doing.</p><p>不，我认为那不是一个好主意。Eddy 帮 Junior 做科学项目时，用的是恐龙电影里的内容，而不是查资料。结果这个项目错误百出，比如说人类骑恐龙。很明显，Eddy 根本不知道自己在做什么。</p><h4 id="🌟-ielts-speaking-band-7-5–8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-ielts-speaking-band-7-5–8"><span>🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.5–8</span></a></h4><p>In my opinion, it was not a good idea for Eddy to assist Junior with his homework. While <strong>parental</strong> support is valuable, it&#39;s <strong>crucial</strong> that students complete their assignments independently to <strong>develop essential research and critical thinking skills</strong>. In the story &quot;Eddy&#39;s Meeting,&quot; Eddy&#39;s involvement in Junior&#39;s science project <strong>led to several inaccuracies</strong>, such as the incorrect claim that humans rode dinosaurs. This example highlights that, despite good intentions, parental assistance can sometimes hinder a child&#39;s learning process. Therefore, it&#39;s more beneficial for parents to guide and support their children rather than completing tasks on their behalf.</p><p>我认为，Eddy 帮 Junior 做作业并不是一个好主意。虽然家长的支持很重要，但学生应该独立完成作业，以培养他们的思考能力。在故事《Eddy’s Meeting》中，Eddy 的帮助反而让科学项目出现了很多错误，比如说人类骑着恐龙。这说明即使出于好意，家长的介入有时也可能起反效果。因此，家长最好是提供指导，而不是直接代劳。</p><ul><li>Fluency and Coherence – Band 8 <ul><li>The ideas flow logically and are well connected.</li><li>There&#39;s a clear structure: opinion → justification → example → conclusion.</li></ul></li><li>Lexical Resource – Band 7.5 to 8 <ul><li>Uses a wide range of vocabulary: assist, independently, critical thinking, inaccuracies, intentions, on their behalf.</li><li>No repetition or awkward phrasing.</li></ul></li><li>Grammatical Range and Accuracy – Band 8 <ul><li>Sentences are varied in structure, and all grammar is accurate.</li><li>Proper use of conditionals, passive voice, and noun phrases.</li></ul></li><li>Pronunciation (if spoken) – Not applicable here in writing, but assuming clear delivery, would likely be Band 7.5+.</li></ul><hr><ul><li>parental: 英 /pəˈrentl/ 美 /pəˈrentl/ <ul><li>adj. 父母的</li><li>adv. 父母般地 <ul><li>问题儿童教养院</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="practice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice"><span>Practice</span></a></h4><p>No, I don&#39;t think that was a good idea.
