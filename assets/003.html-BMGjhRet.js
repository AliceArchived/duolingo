If someone has convinced you that they&#39;re perfect, then they&#39;re probably hiding a <strong>sinister</strong> secret.</p><p>To demonstrate what I mean, I&#39;ll tell you a story.</p><p>Years ago, I fell in love with a restaurant owner. He was beautiful, hilarious, and an extremely talented chef.</p><p>He also took me on <strong>lavish</strong> vacations to incredible destinations.</p><p>He seemed perfect, but after six months of dating, he confessed that he was an <strong>assassin</strong> and that all those vacations were work trips. He told me that his next mission was to kill my ex-boss.</p><p>Of course, I escaped out of the window immediately, notified my former boss, and we never saw each other again. Even now, I wonder what else he was hiding. Did he even enjoy cooking?</p><p>In short, there&#39;s probably something horribly wrong with your boyfriend.</p><p>You need to find someone with more obvious <strong>flaws</strong>, and then you won&#39;t be unpleasantly surprised later.</p><p>Good Luck!</p><p>Lucy</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>sinister: 英 /ˈsɪnɪstə(r)/, 美 /ˈsɪnɪstər/ <em>adj.</em> 危险的, 不吉祥的, 凶兆的, 险恶的</li><li>assassin: <em>n.</em> 暗杀者, 行刺者</li></ul>',20)]))}const d=a(r,[["render",s],["__file","003.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/story/D/003.html","title":"Dear Lucy - B2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"Dear Lucy - B2","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Vocabulary","slug":"vocabulary","link":"#vocabulary","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1747877009000},"filePathRelative":"story/D/003.md"}');export{d as comp,p as data};
