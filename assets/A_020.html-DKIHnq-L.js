This is going to be the best summer ever!</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: I&#39;d rather be home watching TV. This is going to be the worst summer ever.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: Lily, our generation will be the first to go to Mars! We need to learn how to be astronauts.</li></ul><p>The owner of the camp, JJ, overhears their conversation.</p><ul><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Actually, because of a lawsuit, we&#39;re not allowed to tell campers that we&#39;re training them to be astronauts.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: Oh... but we&#39;ll still learn about what it&#39;s like to go to space, right?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Yes! You&#39;ll learn what it&#39;s like in space by bouncing on our zero gravity training device!</li></ul><p>JJ points to a nearby trampoline.</p><ul><li><strong>Lily</strong>: That&#39;s a broken trampoline.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: Lily, don&#39;t be rude! I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fixing it.</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Uhh... Yeah, sure.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: So, when will we meet a real astronaut?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Actually, the astronaut is going to a different space-themed camp that is willing to pay her. <ul><li>But we have other fun activities!</li></ul></li></ul><p>JJ takes them to a muddy field.</p><ul><li><strong>JJ</strong>: This field is basically the same as the atmosphere on Mars! Tomorrow, you&#39;ll spend the whole day here, digging up space rocks.</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: Is digging up rocks really what astronauts would do on Mars?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: That&#39;s all there is to do on Mars.</li></ul><p>Zari <strong>nods</strong>, and they continue walking.</p><ul><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Welcome to your spaceships, where you&#39;ll be sleeping all summer!</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: These are just cheap tents.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: This will teach us about becoming astronauts, right?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Right! It&#39;ll be just like living on Mars because there&#39;s no plumbing!</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: No plumbing?! How will we take showers?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: You won&#39;t! Because ...</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: Let me guess... astronauts don&#39;t shower?</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: You were right, Lily. We can learn about space by watching &quot;Space Viking&quot; movies. Let&#39;s go home.</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: You can leave, but you&#39;ll miss the greatest summer of your lives! <ul><li>Also, refunds aren&#39;t allowed.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h3><ul><li>Astronaut 英 /ˈæstrənɔːt/,美 /ˈæstrənɔːt/ <ul><li>noun a person whose job involves travelling and working in a spacecraft 宇航员；航天员； 太空人</li></ul></li><li>Overhear: <strong>verb</strong> (<strong>over·heard</strong>, <strong>over·heard</strong> to hear, especially by accident, a conversation in which you are not involved 偶然听到；无意中听到: <ul><li><strong>[VN]</strong> We talked quietly so as not to be overheard. 我们低声交谈,以免别人听到。</li></ul></li><li><strong>Gravity</strong>: grav·ity noun[U] <ol><li>(abbr. g) the force that attracts objects in space towards each other, and that on the earth pulls them towards the centre of the planet, so that things fall to the ground when they are dropped 重力；地球引力: <ul><li>Newton&#39;s law of gravity 牛顿万有引力定律</li></ul></li><li>(formal) extreme importance and a cause for worry 严重性 SYN seriousness : <ul><li>I don&#39;t think you realise the gravity of the situation. 我认为你没有意识到形势的严重性。</li></ul></li></ol><ul><li>Punishment varies according to the gravity of the offence. 处罚根据罪行的严重程度而有所不同。</li></ul><ol start="3"><li>(formal) serious behaviour, speech or appearance 严肃；庄严: <ul><li>They were asked to behave with the gravity that was appropriate in a court of law. 他们被要求在法庭上表现出应有的严肃态度。</li></ul></li></ol></li><li>trampoline: 英 /&#39;træmpəliːn/, 美 /&#39;træmpəlin/ <ol><li>noun, a piece of equipment that is used in gymnastics for doing jumps in the air.
