When she <strong>bought</strong> the old oven, it was $500 cheaper, but the oven was damaged after she cleaned it. <strong>Fixing</strong> it will cost $1000. <strong>Even after subtracting</strong> the $500 she <strong>initially</strong> saved, it still <strong>ends up</strong> costing $500 more than <strong>just</strong> buying a new oven <strong>in the first place</strong>.</p><p>不，我认为林最后其实没有省下任何钱。她买的旧烤箱虽然便宜了 500 美元，但在清洁过程中却损坏了。修理费用是 1000 美元。即使减去她省下的那 500 美元，整体花费也比一开始直接买个新烤箱还贵了 500 美元。</p><h3 id="story" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#story"><span>Story</span></a></h3><p>In the story, Lin purchases a used oven for the bakery, claiming it was $500 cheaper than a new one. However, the oven emits a strong fishy smell, attracting stray cats into the bakery. When Lin attempts to mask the odor with air freshener while the oven is still on, it catches fire.
