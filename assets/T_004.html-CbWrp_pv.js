However, soon I realized that it was just a surprise birthday party. This was especially surprising for me because my birthday is next month!</p><p>I was very moved by <strong>everyone&#39;s contributions to</strong> make this party special. When I saw the single balloon tied to a chair, I knew that my granddaughter Lin must have been in charge of decorations. (&quot;everyone&#39;s <strong>efforts</strong> to make this party special&quot;, Efforts” fits better here; “contributions to make” is a bit awkward.)</p><p>It was perfect because cleaning up at the end of the night was incredibly easy!</p><p>As I came to find out, Eddy was in charge of food, which explains why there was only a single bag of <strong>stale</strong> potato chips.</p><p>Everyone likes watching other people play video games, so I know we all enjoyed the Space Zombies tournament that Junior organized. However, it was only a single game, so no one other than Junior got a chance to play.</p><p>I also really appreciated the lovely single bottle of wine Oscar brought to the party and the extremely <strong>informative</strong> two-hour lecture he gave about the wine&#39;s origins.</p><p>I was worried that I was going to have to tell everyone to leave at the end of the night, but thanks to Oscar&#39;s lecture, everyone left <strong>voluntarily</strong>!</p><p>Thank you all for making me feel so loved. I had such a great time that I&#39;m throwing myself another birthday party on my actual birthday next month!</p><p>See you there!</p><p>Lucy</p><h2 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h2><h3 id="whose-contribution-to-the-party-was-the-worst-why" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#whose-contribution-to-the-party-was-the-worst-why"><span>Whose contribution to the party was the worst?

It wasn’t really a good way to celebrate Lucy’s birthday.</p><p>我认为 Oscar 的贡献最糟糕。他只带来了一瓶酒，还花了两个小时讲述酒的来历。他的冗长演讲让大家提前离开了派对，而不是让派对更有趣。这并不是庆祝 Lucy 生日的好方式。</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>stale: 英 /steɪl/,美 /steɪl/ <strong>adjective</strong><ol><li>(of food, especially bread and cake 食物,尤指面包和糕点) no longer fresh and therefore unpleasant to eat 不新鲜的</li><li>(of air, smoke, etc. 空气、烟等) no longer fresh; smelling unpleasant 不新鲜的；(空气)污浊的；(烟味)难闻的:</li><li>stale cigarette smoke 难闻的烟味儿</li><li>stale sweat 汗臭味</li><li>something that is <strong>stale</strong> has been said or done too many times before and is no longer interesting or exciting 陈腐的；没有新意的；老掉牙的: <ol><li>stale jokes 老掉牙的笑话</li><li>Their marriage had <strong>gone stale</strong>. 他们的婚姻已了无热情。</li></ol></li><li>a person who is <strong>stale</strong> has done the same thing for too long and so is unable to do it well or produce any new ideas (因持续做某事时间太长)厌倦的,腻烦的: <ol><li>After two years in the job, she felt stale and needed a change. 在那个岗位干了十年之后,她觉得腻了,需要换换工作。</li></ol></li><li><strong>stale·ness</strong> <em>noun</em> <strong>[U]</strong></li></ol></li></ul>',27)]))}const h=t(r,[["render",n],["__file","T_004.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/story/T/T_004.html","title":"Thanks for the Memories - B2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"Thanks for the Memories - B2","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Writing","slug":"writing","link":"#writing","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Whose contribution to the party was the worst?
