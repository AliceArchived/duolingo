You can connect with people from different backgrounds and locations, which might not happen in your daily routine. I actually know a few people who found long-term relationships through dating apps, so it can definitely work.</p><p>On the other hand, there are serious risks involved. Online profiles aren’t always honest, and some users have bad intentions. In recent years, there’s been a rise in online scams and emotional manipulation. Some people even create fake identities just to take advantage of others. So I think while dating apps can be useful, users really need to stay cautious and not trust someone too quickly.</p><p>In the end, it depends on how you use them.

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in online scams and dishonest behavior on these platforms, which makes users more cautious and distrustful. Moreover, it has been reported that many former employees of dating app companies have resigned to become matchmakers on <strong>live-streaming platforms</strong>. This trend suggests that although people are still interested in finding <strong>romantic partners</strong>, they are seeking <strong>alternatives</strong> to traditional dating apps, possibly due to safety concerns and the desire for more <strong>authentic</strong>, human-centered interactions.</p><p>在我看来，交友软件已不再是建立真诚关系的可靠方式。近年来，这些平台上的诈骗和虚假行为显著增加，使用户变得更加谨慎和不信任。此外，有报道称，许多交友平台的前员工已辞职，转而在直播平台上担任红娘。这一趋势表明，尽管人们仍希望找到伴侣，但他们正在寻找替代传统交友软件的方式，可能是出于安全考虑，也可能是希望获得更真实、更以人为本的互动。</p><h4 id="亮点表达整理" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#亮点表达整理"><span>亮点表达整理</span></a></h4><table><thead><tr><th>表达</th><th>用法说明</th><th>中文解释</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>are no longer a reliable way to...</strong></td><td>表达“某事已不再是…的可靠方式”，用于否定过去的常态</td><td>不再是可靠的方式</td></tr><tr><td><strong>build genuine relationships</strong></td><td>替代“make friends”或“date”，更正式更具体</td><td>建立真诚的关系</td></tr><tr><td><strong>a significant increase in...</strong></td><td>固定搭配，学术写作常用，表示“显著增加”</td><td>…的显著增长</td></tr><tr><td><strong>dishonest behavior on these platforms</strong></td><td>表达“平台上的不良行为”时的正式说法</td><td>在平台上的不诚实行为</td></tr><tr><td><strong>makes users more cautious and distrustful</strong></td><td>表达影响结果时常用，逻辑清晰</td><td>让用户变得更加警惕和不信任</td></tr><tr><td><strong>have resigned to become matchmakers</strong></td><td>表达“辞职去做某事”的自然结构</td><td>辞职去做红娘</td></tr><tr><td><strong>live-streaming platforms</strong></td><td>替代 “live streams” 更正式，技术类写作常用表达</td><td>直播平台</td></tr><tr><td><strong>seeking alternatives to...</strong></td><td>表达“寻找替代方案”非常地道</td><td>寻找替代…的方式</td></tr><tr><td><strong>safety concerns</strong></td><td>表达“出于安全方面的顾虑”，写作常见搭配</td><td>安全隐忧</td></tr><tr><td><strong>authentic, human-centered interactions</strong></td><td>表达“真实的、以人为本的交流”，提升语义深度</td><td>真实、注重人的交流方式</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="型结构模板" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#型结构模板"><span>型结构模板</span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>In my view, ... are no longer a reliable way to...</strong></li><li><strong>There has been a significant increase in...</strong></li><li><strong>This trend suggests that although..., people are seeking...</strong></li></ul><h3 id="🌟-band-8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-band-8"><span>🌟 Band 8</span></a></h3><p>In my opinion, dating apps have become an increasingly unreliable <strong>avenue</strong> for <strong>forming</strong> meaningful relationships.
