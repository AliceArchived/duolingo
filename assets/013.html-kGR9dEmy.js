He seems more <strong>focused on himself</strong> than on the students. When he announced that the winner would <strong>get to spend</strong> hours <strong>hearing</strong> him talk about his own paintings, it didn’t sound like a fun or inspiring experience. I’d prefer a program <strong>where students get to learn, explore, and share their own ideas</strong>.</p><p>不，我不想去 Oscar 的艺术项目。他看起来更关注自己，而不是学生。当他说获胜者将花上好几个小时听他讲自己的画作时，这听起来一点都不有趣也不激励人。我更喜欢那种让学生学习、探索并分享自己创意的课程。</p><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>Wow, this is hard to watch. <ul><li>Lily struggles to be friendly with people.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>thrilling: 令人激动的</li><li>podium: 演讲台</li></ul>',24)]))}const g=o(r,[["render",s],["__file","013.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/story/T/013.html","title":"The Art Competition - B2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"The Art Competition - B2","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Writing","slug":"writing","link":"#writing","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Would you like to go to Oscar's art program?
