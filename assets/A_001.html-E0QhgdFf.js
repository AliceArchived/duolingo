While I wish I could, we&#39;re both only eight years old.</p><p>And although I can do a lot of adult things, like order pizza with my dad&#39;s credit card, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m ready for this kind of commitment.</p><p>I know I said yes in the moment, but that&#39;s only because you offered me a cookie, and I make bad decisions when I&#39;m hungry.</p><p>At this age, we need to focus on ourselves. I saw the skateboarding alien you drew instead of taking notes in math class, and I think having a boyfriend would distract you from a successful career illustrating comic books.</p><p>Besides, as I&#39;ve learned from my dad, dating only leads to heartbreak.</p><p>You have no idea how many times I&#39;ve caught him eating all my ice cream after a difficult breakup.</p><p>But most importantly, my heart already belongs to someone else — my <strong>neighbor</strong>, Lily. She&#39;s in love with me, too. It might just take her ten years to realize it.</p><p>In conclusion, I&#39;m not interested in dating anyone ... except Lily.</p><p>Sorry,</p><p>Junior</p><hr><h3 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h3><h4 id="what-do-you-think-of-junior-s-reasons-for-not-dating-elise-why" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-you-think-of-junior-s-reasons-for-not-dating-elise-why"><span>What do you think of Junior&#39;s reasons for not dating Elise?
