Your dad mentioned you love frogs, so I brought you a surprise.</li></ul><p>Angela hands Junior a small tank with a frog in it.</p><ul><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Wow, thanks! I&#39;ll put him with the others!</li></ul><p>Junior takes the frog and opens the bathroom door. Dozens of frogs jump out. Angela looks horrified.</p><ul><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: Uhh..
