I know how important this is to you. And I brought some extra ingredients to help us win.</li><li><strong>Vikram</strong>: What?!

If you want to win, you have to do something special!</li></ul><p>The producer <strong>makes an announcement</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Producer</strong>: You have one hour to bake your cakes. Go!</li><li><strong>Vikram</strong>: Please follow my recipe, Lin! Just add the flour and sugar...</li></ul><p>Lin adds the flour and sugar — and some small pieces of cheese.</p><ul><li><strong>Vikram</strong>: No!</li><li><strong>Lin</strong>: Cheese will make this cake much more interesting.</li><li><strong>Vikram</strong>: I don&#39;t want an interesting cake!</li><li><strong>Lin</strong>: And I added <strong>beet juice</strong>.

It&#39;s time to put your cakes in the oven.</li><li><strong>Vikram</strong>: Maybe it will be OK ...</li></ul><p>While the cake bakes, Lin puts a scarf around Vikram&#39;s neck.</p><ul><li><strong>Lin</strong>: If you want to be on TV, then you need to look cool.</li><li><strong>Vikram</strong>: We need to pay attention to the cake. I don&#39;t want it to burn ... Oh no!</li></ul><p>Vikram takes the cake out of the oven. It&#39;s on fire.</p><ul><li><strong>Lin</strong>: Use the scarf!</li></ul><p>Vikram uses the scarf to stop the fire.
