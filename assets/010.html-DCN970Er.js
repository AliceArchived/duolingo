According to the parenting book I&#39;ve been reading, it&#39;s very important for children to clean their rooms.

Most people never even cure one! <ul><li>That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to be in charge from now on, Junior.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: I&#39;ll make my bed if you get us pizza for dinner.</li></ul><p>Eddy opens his parenting book.</p><ul><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: The book doesn&#39;t say anything about pizza, so I guess that&#39;s OK.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: And I&#39;ll clean the whole room if we can get ice cream afterward.</li><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: Alright. I want ice cream too, so I&#39;m technically still in charge of this situation.</li></ul><p>Eddy turns to another chapter in his book.</p><ul><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: The book also says that it&#39;s important for you to help with chores. <ul><li>So please take out the trash.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Hmm ... I&#39;ll do it if I can make a pond with dirt and rocks for my pet frog.</li><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: Junior, we&#39;ve talked about this. No more ponds in the bathtub.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Fine then, I won&#39;t take out the trash.</li></ul><p>Eddy desperately looks through the book.</p><ul><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: Oh no, the book definitely doesn&#39;t say anything about frogs!</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Then we have a deal!</li></ul><p>An hour later, Eddy brings Junior pizza and ice cream while Junior&#39;s frog swims in the dirt-filled bathtub.</p><ul><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Thanks, Dad! You did everything I asked.</li><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: I was supposed to be in charge.
