You should be prepared to arrive twenty minutes to two hours late.</li></ol><p>If I don&#39;t get a response from you regarding this email, then I will assume you have agreed to the above rules.</p><p>Thanks for your cooperation!</p><p>Your granddaughter,</p><p>Lin</p>',12)]))}const l=t(i,[["render",n],["__file","065.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/story/T/065.html","title":"The Roommate Agreement - B2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"The Roommate Agreement - B2","description":"some description"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1747509364000},"filePathRelative":"story/T/065.md"}');export{l as comp,d as data};
