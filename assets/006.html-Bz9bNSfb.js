Terry was slowly walking by with a piece of trash stuck to his injured <strong>flipper</strong>.</p><p>After Bea removed the piece of trash, the turtle, according to Bea, raised his flipper in a &quot;gesture of thanks.&quot;</p><p>Then, as Bea described it:</p><p>Terry high-fived me!</p><p><strong>Bea</strong>: As he slowly touched my hand, I suddenly realized that I needed to slow down, just like Terry and stop trying so hard by <strong>volunteering</strong> and working all the time.</p><p>After initially considering <strong>converting</strong> a room in her apartment into a turtle habitat, Bea ultimately decided to bring Terry to the <strong>aquarium</strong> so his flipper could heal.</p><p>After that, Bea did &quot;slow down&quot; briefly before organizing a weekly trash cleanup effort at the beach.</p><p>Join Bea every Saturday morning at 6 a.m. because, as she describes it:</p><p><strong>Bea</strong>: It&#39;s always better to start early so you have more hours in the day to work!</p><p>While we&#39;re looking forward to your next visit to the aquarium, please note that we will have increased security around Terry&#39;s enclosure.</p><p>This is because several visitors who heard Bea&#39;s story tried to reach in and give Terry a high five. Now dozens of fans spend the day waiting to see who Terry will high-five next, even if it&#39;s only through the glass of his enclosure.</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>Aquarium: 水族馆</li><li>Newsletter: 通讯</li><li>Enclosure: 围场</li><li>Flipper: 鳍 英 /&#39;flɪpə/ 美 /ˈflɪpɚ/</li></ul>',15)]))}const h=t(o,[["render",s],["__file","006.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/story/C/006.html","title":"City Aquarium Newsletter - B2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"City Aquarium Newsletter - B2","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Vocabulary","slug":"vocabulary","link":"#vocabulary","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1747871587000},"filePathRelative":"story/C/006.md"}');export{h as comp,u as data};
