Walking! When you walk, it&#39;s easy to stop and look at a cool rock or a neat frog.</p><p>Plus, you can play an actual video game while you&#39;re walking. You can&#39;t do that on a bicycle unless you want to fall off.</p><p>Another option that&#39;s better than biking is skateboarding. Why be limited by two wheels when you can have four?</p><p>A bicycle is boring because it only moves forward instead of <strong>in every direction</strong>, and you also have to sit down while you ride.
