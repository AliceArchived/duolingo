In case you would like to give me a gift, here are my new, sophisticated interests that are way better than the kids&#39; stuff I used to like.</p><p>Everyone knows candy is for children, which is why, as an older kid, I prefer fancy, dark chocolate.</p><p>Apparently, it&#39;s good for you because it contains less sugar than milk chocolate, which is exactly the kind of thing grown-ups care about.</p><p>That means I can eat as much as I want!</p><p>Although I love my pet frog, Sugar, a more mature animal would be a better pet for someone as wise and experienced as me.</p><p>So if you&#39;re wondering what to get me, a huge, fifty-year-old tortoise would be a great choice instead of another frog, which is a pet for babies.</p><p>When I was a kid, I loved to play video games because they were fun.</p><p>But now, I play video games to learn important skills that I will need as a grown-up, like how to fight zombies and dance in space.</p><p>So I&#39;d like some new, more expensive video games to help me prepare for being an adult.</p><p>Lastly, like all adults, I also love cash. In fact, that&#39;s what I&#39;d prefer!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Junior</p><hr><h3 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h3><h4 id="do-you-think-junior-understands-what-it-means-to-be-an-adult-why" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#do-you-think-junior-understands-what-it-means-to-be-an-adult-why"><span>Do you think Junior understands what it means to be an adult?

As an adult, if one <strong>asks for</strong> something, they also need to provide something in exchange. Junior surely doesn&#39;t understand that.</p><blockquote><ol><li>Since you’re judging Junior based on what he wrote and he already <em>claims</em> to be an “older kid,” your sentence should reflect that you&#39;re evaluating his <strong>self-perception</strong>, not describing a process of growing.</li><li>“but still a kid” is a sentence fragment; it should be combined properly.</li><li>Repetition of “As an adult” sounds awkward; consider varying the structure.</li><li>“If one asks for something, they also need to provide something in exchange” is acceptable, but “should be ready to give something in return” sounds smoother.</li></ol></blockquote><p>In my opinion, Junior <strong>may call himself</strong> an older kid, but <strong>he’s</strong> still <strong>just</strong> a kid.
