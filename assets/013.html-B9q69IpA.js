What if I try something different?</li></ul><p>Eddy jumps, lands on one knee, and gazes at the apple as if that one piece of fruit contained all his hopes and dreams.</p><ul><li><strong>Woman</strong>: Better, but I&#39;m still not convinced. Can you try holding some toilet paper instead?</li></ul><p>Eddy takes a deep breath as he tears open a large pack of toilet paper. He grabs a few rolls and starts juggling them. The toilet paper flies everywhere.</p><ul><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: What do you think?</li><li><strong>Woman</strong>: Bravo! We&#39;re filming a toilet paper commercial in Vancouver. Are you able to be on set next weekend?</li><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: Absolutely!</li></ul><p>As the woman leaves, a store employee walks over to Eddy.</p><ul><li><strong>Eddy</strong> : Can you believe it? I got a part in a commercial!</li><li><strong>Employee</strong>: Congrats.
