Well, I&#39;m writing to tell you that I feel it&#39;s unfair for me to continue doing my <strong>chores</strong> until you pay me back.</p><p>Therefore, until your loan has been repaid to me in full, the following chores will be reassigned to you:</p><p><strong>Washing Dishes</strong></p><p>You&#39;ll be responsible for washing the dishes every day. And you may not put them away while they are still wet.</p><p>As you always <strong>say</strong>, &quot;Washing the dishes includes drying the dishes.&quot; I think this rule is <strong>dumb</strong>, but it&#39;s your rule, so you must follow it.</p><p>Also, don&#39;t cheat and buy paper plates. It&#39;s bad for the environment.</p><p><strong>Picking Up My Toys</strong></p><p>Please put all of my toys into the big blue box in my closet. You have my permission to play with my action figures, but don&#39;t put Skull Man in the closet. He is afraid of the dark.</p><p>And because I&#39;m feeling generous, you may play my video games before putting them away. Just don&#39;t change my settings!</p><p><strong>Cleaning the Bathroom</strong></p><p>I propose that we eliminate this chore. Why do we have to clean the bathroom at all? Doesn&#39;t the toilet clean itself every time you flush?</p><p>Let&#39;s just stop doing it. We&#39;ll both be happier.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t paid me back by next week, expect more of my chores to be added to this list.</p><p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Junior</p>',18)]))}const l=t(a,[["render",r],["__file","004.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/story/E/004.html","title":"Eddy's Chores - B2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"Eddy's Chores - B2","description":"some description"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1747886456000},"filePathRelative":"story/E/004.md"}`);export{l as comp,h as data};
