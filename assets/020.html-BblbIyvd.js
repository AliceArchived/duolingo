This is going to be the best summer ever!</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: I&#39;d rather be home watching TV.

We need to learn how to be astronauts.</li></ul><p>The owner of the camp, JJ, <strong>overhears</strong> their conversation.</p><ul><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Actually, because of a lawsuit, we&#39;re not allowed to tell campers that we&#39;re training them to be astronauts.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: Oh... but we&#39;ll still learn about what it&#39;s like to go to space, right?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Yes! You&#39;ll learn what it&#39;s like in space by bouncing on our zero gravity training device!</li></ul><p>JJ points to a nearby trampoline.</p><ul><li><strong>Lily</strong>: That&#39;s a broken trampoline.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: Lily, don&#39;t be rude! I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fixing it.</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Uhh... Yeah, sure.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: So, when will we meet a real astronaut?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Actually, the astronaut is going to a different <strong>space-themed camp</strong> that is willing to pay her. <ul><li>But we have other fun activities!</li></ul></li></ul><p>JJ takes them to a muddy field.</p><ul><li><strong>JJ</strong>: This field is basically the same as the <strong>atmosphere</strong> on Mars! Tomorrow, you&#39;ll spend the whole day here, digging up space rocks.</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: Is digging up rocks really what astronauts would do on Mars?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: That&#39;s all there is to do on Mars.</li></ul><p>Zari <strong>nods</strong>, and they continue walking.</p><ul><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Welcome to your spaceships, where you&#39;ll be sleeping all summer!</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: These are just cheap tents.</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: This will teach us about becoming astronauts, right?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: Right! It&#39;ll be just like living on Mars because there&#39;s no <strong>plumbing</strong>!</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: No plumbing?! How will we take showers?</li><li><strong>JJ</strong>: You won&#39;t! Because ...</li><li><strong>Lily</strong>: Let me guess... astronauts don&#39;t shower?</li><li><strong>Zari</strong>: You were right, Lily. We can learn about space by watching &quot;Space Viking&quot; movies.
