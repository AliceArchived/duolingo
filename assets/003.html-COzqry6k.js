They bring excitement and help us create lasting memories. It’s a great way to add some color to our lives.</p><p>是的，我喜欢隆重的活动。日常生活往往很平淡，所以我觉得我们都需要一些特别的时刻。这些时刻带来兴奋感，也帮助我们留下美好的回忆。这是为生活增添色彩的好方式。</p><hr><h3 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h3><ul><li>I&#39;ve never told you anything about it? <ul><li>Alternative (smoother):</li><li>I&#39;ve never told you about it before?</li></ul></li></ul>',13)]))}const d=n(r,[["render",s],["__file","003.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/story/A/003.html","title":"A Fancy Wedding","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"A Fancy Wedding","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"Writing","slug":"writing","link":"#writing","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Sentences","slug":"sentences","link":"#sentences","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1747411039000},"filePathRelative":"story/A/003.md"}');export{d as comp,g as data};
