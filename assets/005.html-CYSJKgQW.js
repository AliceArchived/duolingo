Technically, I don&#39;t have any restaurant experience, but I took a cooking class after my son said he was tired of eating burned food. I guess that makes me a chef!</p><p>Anyway, if you&#39;re cooking for a date, just follow my tips. If I can do it, so can you!</p><p><strong>Cook Multiple Dishes</strong></p><p>Rather than cooking one dish, cook five! This way, if four of them taste horrible, one of them will probably taste acceptable.</p><p>You&#39;ll also have plenty of leftovers, so if you have a second date the same week, you don&#39;t have to worry about cooking. You can just serve your date the leftovers!</p><p>Or more likely, you can eat them alone.</p><p><strong>Set the Mood</strong></p><p>Before your date arrives, you should set the mood by chilling some wine and lighting candles. Everything looks better in candlelight, which is almost like no light at all!</p><p>And if the candles start a fire, you can use the wine to put it out.</p><p><strong>Ask about Allergies</strong></p><p>Last but not least, always remember to ask about allergies before cooking anything. If you don&#39;t, you could ruin the entire night by giving your date a serious allergic reaction.</p><p>I know from personal experience that if a first date ends at the hospital, it won&#39;t lead to a second date.</p><p>Just follow these tips, and you&#39;ll be impressing your dates like Chef Eddy in no time!</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>Chilling: 冷藏</li><li>Leftovers: 剩菜</li></ul>',17)]))}const d=o(s,[["render",n],["__file","005.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/story/E/005.html","title":"Eddy's Cooking Tips","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"Eddy's Cooking Tips","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Vocabulary","slug":"vocabulary","link":"#vocabulary","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1747886456000},"filePathRelative":"story/E/005.md"}`);export{d as comp,h as data};
