In my experience, it only leads to pain and suffering.</li><li>Similarly, don&#39;t show them your art. (Again, it will only lead to pain and suffering.)</li><li>Don&#39;t let students use their phones in class. This isn&#39;t a school rule, but you and I both know social media is ruining civilization.</li><li>Always create an inspiring atmosphere by playing classical music and <strong>dimming</strong> the lights.</li><li>No eating in class — especially not the grapes that the students are supposed to be painting.</li><li>And most importantly, always remember that art isn&#39;t about having fun. Art is about being inspired, considering the true meaning of life, and painting grapes accurately.</li></ol><p>Is all of that clear?
