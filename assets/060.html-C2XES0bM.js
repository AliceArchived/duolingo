Right now, you&#39;re so bad that your playing gives her a headache.&quot;</p><p>No rejection is too small. You can trust my <strong>satisfied</strong> customers:</p><p>Michelle, happy customer:</p><ul><li><strong>Michelle</strong>: Lily doesn&#39;t care what people think, so she&#39;s the perfect person to deliver bad news.</li></ul><p>Keisha, happy customer:</p><ul><li><strong>Keisha</strong>: I&#39;m so popular that eight guys asked me to the dance. <ul><li>Lily rejected all eight of them in a group text. Easy!</li></ul></li></ul><p>Eddy, sad dad:</p><ul><li><strong>Eddy</strong>: Lily hit me with a <strong>paper airplane</strong> that said, &quot;Junior is quitting baseball.&quot; <ul><li>I&#39;m sad Junior doesn&#39;t want to be on the team I coach, but I am impressed by Lily&#39;s <strong>aim</strong>.</li><li>She&#39;d be great on the team!</li></ul></li></ul><p>And for the small price of $5, I can also make the perfect playlist of sad songs to comfort the people you&#39;ve rejected.</p><h2 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h2><h3 id="would-you-pay-lily-to-deliver-your-bad-news-why-or-why-not" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#would-you-pay-lily-to-deliver-your-bad-news-why-or-why-not"><span>Would you pay Lily to deliver your bad news?
