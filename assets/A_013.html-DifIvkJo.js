Now, he <strong>dedicates</strong> every day to sleep.</p><p>In fact, he&#39;s so <strong>sedentary</strong> that you can use him as a pillow. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll still get your exercise because you&#39;ll have to carry all eighty pounds of Steve during his daily &quot;walks.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hot Dog</strong></p><p>Hot Dog is a 5-year-old <strong>miniature poodle</strong>. Unlike Steve, Hot Dog is full of energy. She needs to play for approximately fifteen hours every day.</p><p>She loves all sports, especially those involving running, chasing, and chewing.</p><p>Speaking of chewing, Hot Dog is the perfect <strong>companion</strong> if you want to have a <strong>minimalist</strong> lifestyle because she&#39;ll slowly but surely destroy all of your belongings.</p><p><strong>Fluffy</strong></p><p>Fluffy is a 3-year-old <strong>terrier</strong>. He&#39;s so adorable that it almost <strong>makes</strong> up for the fact that he requires ridiculous amounts of attention.</p><p>Fluffy&#39;s perfect for an owner who doesn&#39;t have any other obligations in life, like friends, hobbies, or a job. As you can imagine, he&#39;s quite jealous, so don&#39;t even think about petting any other dogs. He&#39;ll know.</p><p>As you can see, each of these dogs is charming in <strong>its</strong> own way. Feel free to come to our shelter anytime.</p><p><strong>Sincerely</strong>,</p><p>Jessie</p><p>Adoption Coordinator</p><hr><h3 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h3><ul><li>Shelter: 收养中心</li><li>hypoallergenic: 符合低过敏性的 <ul><li>英 /ˌhaɪpo,ælɚ&#39;dʒɛnɪk/ 美 /ˌhaɪpoˌælɚˈdʒɛnɪk/</li></ul></li><li>sedentary: 久坐不动的 <ul><li>英 /ˈsedntri/ 美 /ˈsednteri/</li></ul></li><li>Miniature poodles: 迷你贵宾犬 <ul><li>英 /&#39;pu:dl/ 美 /&#39;pu:dl/</li></ul></li><li>minimalist: 简约主义的</li><li>terrier: a small active dog.
