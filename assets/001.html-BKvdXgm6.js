I think your music is unoriginal and you sound like a hundred other bands, but Zari is really sad that you broke up. She&#39;s acting <strong>weird</strong>, and I hate it.</p><p>Based on what I&#39;ve heard when Zari forces me to listen to your music, I assume your band broke up because you hate listening to each other sing.</p><p>Nonetheless, you have to get back together.</p><p>I showed Zari a picture of a penguin riding an escalator yesterday, and she didn&#39;t even smile.</p><p>Additionally, our teachers and classmates have noticed Zari acting differently, and they keep asking me about it. It&#39;s horrible because I <strong>despise</strong> talking to people.</p><p>Believe me, there&#39;s nothing I want more than for each of you to attempt a solo career, realize you have no talent, try to become actors, and then fail at that too.</p><p>However, you need to forget about your pride and get back onstage. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have no choice but do do something embarrassing to try to cheer her up, and I&#39;ll never recover from that.</p><p>In conclusion, you need to get back together right now. Got it? If it helps, I think your one song about how love is pointless is kind of OK.</p><p>Not a fan,</p><p>Lily</p><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>It&#39;s horrible because I despise talking to people. <ul><li>这很糟糕，因为我厌恶与人交谈。</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>Despise: 厌恶</li></ul>',16)]))}const h=t(r,[["render",s],["__file","001.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/story/G/001.html","title":"Get Back Together - B2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"Get Back Together - B2","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Sentences","slug":"sentences","link":"#sentences","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Vocabulary","slug":"vocabulary","link":"#vocabulary","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1747962648000},"filePathRelative":"story/G/001.md"}');export{h as comp,c as data};
